### 📝 About Section (Summary)
```text
I specialize in architecting resilient, cloud-native infrastructure using Kubernetes, GitOps, and observability-first principles. With hands-on expertise across AWS, Terraform, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines, I design and automate systems that scale reliably and securely.

My toolkit includes Helm, ArgoCD, Vault, Prometheus, Grafana, and the ELK stack—empowering teams to deploy faster, monitor smarter, and recover gracefully. Whether it's building Kind clusters for local dev or securing production-grade deployments, I bring precision, adaptability, and a passion for automation to every layer of the stack.

Let’s connect if you're building something bold in cloud infrastructure, DevOps workflows, or platform engineering.
