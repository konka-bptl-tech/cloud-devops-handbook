## **2. DNS & DHCP**

### **DNS (Domain Name System)**

* DNS converts **domain names** into **IP addresses**.
* Works like the **phonebook of the internet**.
* Lets you type `google.com` instead of `142.250.183.14`.
* DNS Port is `53`

### **Types of DNS Records**

| Record    | Purpose                             | Example                          |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **A**     | Domain → IPv4 address               | `example.com → 192.0.2.1`        |
| **AAAA**  | Domain → IPv6 address               | `example.com → 2001:db8::1`      |
| **CNAME** | Alias (one name to another)         | `www.example.com → example.com`  |
| **MX**    | Mail exchange server                | `example.com → mail.example.com` |
| **NS**    | Nameservers for a domain            | `ns1.example.com`                |
| **TXT**   | Holds text info (SPF, verification) | `v=spf1 include:...`             |

### **How DNS Resolution Works (Short)**

1. You type `www.example.com`.
2. Browser asks local **DNS Resolver** (your ISP / 8.8.8.8).
3. Resolver queries **Root DNS** → points to **TLD (.com)**.
4. TLD points to **Authoritative DNS**.
5. Authoritative DNS returns the IP.
6. Browser connects to that IP.

```
Browser
  ↓
DNS Resolver
  ↓
Root Server → TLD Server (.com) → Authoritative Server (example.com)
  ↓
Returns IP (192.0.2.1)
```

### **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**

* **Automatically assigns IP addresses** and other network settings (like gateway, DNS server) to devices on a network.
* Without DHCP, you’d have to manually set IPs on every device.
* Very common in LANs, offices, home routers, and AWS (subnets assign IPs to EC2 instances via DHCP options).
