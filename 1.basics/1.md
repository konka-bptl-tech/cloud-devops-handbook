### **IP Addressing**

* A system to **uniquely identify devices** on a network.
* **IPv4** = 32 bits (e.g. `192.168.1.10`)

  * **Network part** = identifies network
  * **Host part** = identifies device

### **IP Classes (Old System)**

| Class | Range (1st Octet) | Default Mask        | Hosts  |
| ----- | ----------------- | ------------------- | ------ |
| A     | 1â€“126             | 255.0.0.0 (/8)      | Large  |
| B     | 128â€“191           | 255.255.0.0 (/16)   | Medium |
| C     | 192â€“223           | 255.255.255.0 (/24) | Small  |
| D     | 224â€“239           | Multicast           |        |
| E     | 240â€“255           | Reserved            |        |

ðŸ”¹ Private IP ranges:

* `10.0.0.0/8`
* `172.16.0.0/12`
* `192.168.0.0/16`

ðŸ”¹ `127.x.x.x` = Loopback

### **Subnet Mask & CIDR**

* Subnet mask separates **network** vs **host** parts.
* CIDR = short form: `/24` = 255.255.255.0
* Total IPs = `2^(32âˆ’prefix)`

---

### **Public vs Private**

* **Public IP** = Internet reachable
* **Private IP** = Internal use only

---

### **AWS Reserved IPs in VPC Subnet**

AWS automatically reserves:

* **.0** = Network address
* **.1** = VPC Router
* **.2** = DNS
* **.3** = Future use
* **Last IP** = Broadcast

Usable IPs start from `.4`

---

* **Classification (Class A/B/C)** was made in the early days to divide IP space into **large, medium, small networks**.
* **Private IP ranges** were created to **save public IPs** (limited resource) and allow **internal networks** to use IPs without paying or registering them.

So basically:
âž¡ **Classes** = organize networks by size.
âž¡ **Private IPs** = reuse IPs internally & preserve public ones.
