# Migration Strategies

Before going for migration we need to follow certain process we need to create a project for cloud migration in the
project you ideal follow through multiple stages

**1. Preparation**
- MNC have 200 micro services
- Single Monolithic application developers and devops engineers work togerther to transform this monolithic application into Micro services
- During preparation stage you need to check the what is the current architecture of your applications
Note:
----
Containers are light weight simple process that are individually manageble and deployable

**2. Planning**
- Part-1 decide Which micro services goes phase-1...5
- Choose migration strategy to choose
*Rehost*
- Lift & Shift is most popular mechanism that are employeed
- For example you have k8s cluster in private cloud you need to migrate both k8s cluster and applications So you can create same K8s cluster in AWS on top of that you can create ns and deploy the applications corbon copy
it works very well if there is no dependency OS , H/W and environment
*Replatform*
*Refactor/Rearchitecture*
*Relocate*
*Retire*
*Retain*
*Repurpose*

**3. Migrate**
Take Phase-1 completed migration as per planning
- We can write some scripts[terraform,CI/CD pipelines]

**4. Monitor**
Once the migration completed monitor application a while 1 month or 2 month depending upon the criticality of applications we give to beta customers customers or internal customers why don't share you the performance feedback
If everything is okay my phase-1 migration is good

**5. Optimize**
- Improvements
- Let's say we migrated all 200 micro services cloud we need to evoluate is there advantage or not what did I achieve did i get cost benefit reduce maintainance overhead
- 40% cost optimzation by migrating applcations in to cloud 
- Can we increase 40% to 50% if we do we can create jiras create some tasks 
- Preparation & Planning is one time activity
- Migration goes through multiple phases[1,2,3 years as well]
- Monitor  ---------
- Optimize one time activity

Be careful while migrating databases

I work cloud mogration just for 6 months not encounter the scenario giving an oppurtunity I'll learn it
