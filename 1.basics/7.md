**Proxy = Intermediary between client & server.**

### Forward Proxy

* **Hides client** from server.
* **Example:** Company proxy to access websites.
* **Advantages:**

  * Anonymity
  * Block/unblock websites
  * Faster with caching

### Reverse Proxy

* **Hides server** from clients.
* **Example:** Nginx or AWS ALB in front of web servers.
* **Advantages:**

  * Protect servers
  * Load balancing
  * SSL termination
  * Faster with caching

## Advantages of Proxy Servers

### Forward Proxy

1. **Client anonymity** – Hides client IP from external servers.
2. **Access control** – Can block or allow websites for users.
3. **Caching** – Stores frequently accessed content to improve speed.
4. **Security** – Can filter malicious content before reaching clients.

### Reverse Proxy

1. **Server protection** – Hides internal server IPs from clients.
2. **Load balancing** – Distributes traffic across multiple servers.
3. **SSL/TLS termination** – Handles encryption, reducing load on backend servers.
4. **Caching & compression** – Speeds up responses and reduces server load.
5. **Centralized logging & monitoring** – Tracks requests centrally.
