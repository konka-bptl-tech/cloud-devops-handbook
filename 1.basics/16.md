## 16. Message Queues

### Definition

* **Message Queue:** A system that **stores and forwards messages** between applications or services to enable **asynchronous communication**.
* **Purpose:** Decouples producers (senders) and consumers (receivers), improves scalability and reliability.

### Examples

* **RabbitMQ:** Traditional message broker, supports queues, routing, and acknowledgments
* **Amazon SQS:** Fully managed cloud-based queue, simple and scalable
* **Kafka:** Distributed streaming platform, handles high throughput, persists messages

| Message Queue   |  <- Stores messages temporarily
| (RabbitMQ/SQS/  |
|  Kafka)         |

```

**Key points for interview:**

* **Producers send messages** → stored in queue
* **Consumers read messages** → decouples sender and receiver
* Supports **asynchronous processing** and **scalability**

## Synchronous vs Asynchronous

### 1. Synchronous

* **Definition:** Tasks are executed **one after another**, and the caller **waits** for the response before continuing.
* **Example:** HTTP request-response, calling a function and waiting for it to finish.
* **Key point:** **Blocking**; next task starts only after current finishes.

---

### 2. Asynchronous

* **Definition:** Tasks are executed **independently**, and the caller **doesn’t wait** for the response.
* **Example:** Message queues (RabbitMQ, SQS), async API calls, callbacks in JavaScript.
* **Key point:** **Non-blocking**; tasks can run in parallel.

---

### ASCII Visual

```
Synchronous:
Task1 ---> Task2 ---> Task3
(wait for previous task to finish)

Asynchronous:
Task1 --\
          ---> Task2 (can run later)
Task3 --/
(doesn’t wait for others)
```

**Memory Tip:**

* **Synchronous = blocking**
* **Asynchronous = non-blocking**
