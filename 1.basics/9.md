## 9. Load Balancers

**Load Balancer:** Distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to **improve performance, reliability, and availability**.

### Types by OSI Layer

1. **Layer 4 (Transport Level)**

* Operates at **TCP/UDP layer**.
* Distributes traffic based on **IP address and port**.
* Faster because it doesnâ€™t inspect application data.
* Example: AWS NLB (Network Load Balancer).

2. **Layer 7 (Application Level)**

* Operates at **HTTP/HTTPS layer**.
* Distributes traffic based on **content, URL, headers, cookies**.
* Can perform **advanced routing, SSL termination, caching**.
* Example: AWS ALB (Application Load Balancer).

### Load Balancing Algorithms

| Algorithm                | How it Works                                          | Use Case                              |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Round Robin**          | Requests distributed evenly, one by one               | Simple, equal servers                 |
| **Least Connections**    | Request sent to server with fewest active connections | Servers with uneven load              |
| **IP Hash**              | Client IP determines which server gets the request    | Session persistence, stickiness       |
| **Weighted Round Robin** | Servers with higher capacity get more requests        | When servers have different resources |

**Easy way to say:**

* **L4 LB:** fast, based on IP/port
* **L7 LB:** smart, based on content
* **Algorithms:** round robin, least connections, IP hash, weighted
