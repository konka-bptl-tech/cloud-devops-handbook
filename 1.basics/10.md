## 10. SSL / TLS

**SSL/TLS:** Protocols that **encrypt data** between client and server to ensure **confidentiality, integrity, and authentication**.

* SSL = Secure Sockets Layer (older)
* TLS = Transport Layer Security (modern, more secure)

### 1. SSL Termination

* **Definition:** Decrypting incoming SSL/TLS traffic at the **load balancer or proxy** instead of the backend server.
* **Purpose:** Offloads encryption work from servers → reduces server load.
* **Example:** ALB or Nginx decrypts HTTPS traffic and forwards it as HTTP to backend.

**Easy way to say:** “SSL termination stops encryption at the load balancer, backend gets plain traffic.”

### 2. TLS 3-Way Handshake

* **Purpose:** Establish a **secure session** between client and server.
* **Steps:**

  1. **Client Hello** – Client sends supported TLS versions, ciphers, random number.
  2. **Server Hello** – Server selects TLS version, cipher, sends certificate.
  3. **Client Key Exchange** – Client sends session key info, both sides generate shared session key.

**Easy way to say:** “Client and server exchange keys and agree on encryption to start a secure session.”

**Summary:**

* **SSL/TLS:** Encrypts data
* **SSL Termination:** Offloads decryption to LB/proxy
* **TLS Handshake:** Secure session setup between client and server
