Here’s a **compact, interview-ready explanation** including SSO:

## 6. Authentication vs Authorization (with SSO)

* **Authentication (AuthN)** – Verifies **who you are**.

  * Example: Login with username/password, OTP.
  * Think: “Prove your identity.”

* **Authorization (AuthZ)** – Determines **what you can access**.

  * Example: User can read files but cannot delete them.
  * Think: “Check permissions.”

* **SSO (Single Sign-On)** – Lets a user **login once** and access **multiple applications** without re-entering credentials.

  * Example: Login to Google account → access Gmail, Drive, YouTube automatically.
  * Helps **centralize authentication** and improve user experience.

**Easy memory:**

* AuthN = Identity check
* AuthZ = Permission check
* SSO = One login for multiple apps

```
User Login
   |
   v
Authentication (AuthN)
   - Verify identity (username/password, OTP)
   |
   v
Single Sign-On (SSO)
   - User logged in once
   - Access multiple apps without re-login
   |
   v
Authorization (AuthZ)
   - Check what resources user can access
   - Example: Read, write, delete permissions
```

**Key points to explain:**

1. First, the system **authenticates** who you are.
2. With **SSO**, you don’t need to login separately for each app.
3. Finally, **authorization** decides what actions or data you can access.
