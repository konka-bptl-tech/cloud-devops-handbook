DevOps isn't defined by your tools:
 ðŸš« Kubernetes
 ðŸš« Cloud Native
 ðŸš« Terraform / Ansible
 ðŸš« GCP 
 ðŸš« CI/CD
 ðŸš« Docker

Those are just tools - not DevOps itself.
DevOps is about designing systems that:
 â€¢ Deploy code reliably
 â€¢ Scale infrastructure effortlessly
 â€¢ Detect issues early
 â€¢ Stay secure and stable
 â€¢ Enable smooth team collaboration

True DevOps is a mindset focused on:
 â€¢ Automating with intent
 â€¢ Monitoring before things break
 â€¢ Scaling with purpose
 â€¢ Securing every layer
 â€¢ Improving continuously
