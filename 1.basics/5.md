### Firewall

A **firewall** is a network security device that **controls incoming and outgoing traffic** based on rules to protect systems from unauthorized access.

### 1. Stateful Firewall

* Tracks the **state of active connections**.
* Allows **return traffic automatically** if part of an established connection.
* Example: Client requests HTTP → firewall allows the response back automatically.

**Key points to say:** “Stateful firewall remembers connections and allows responses automatically.”

---

### 2. Stateless Firewall

* Filters **each packet individually** based on rules.
* Does **not track connection state**.
* Example: You allow SSH on port 22 → you must explicitly allow return traffic.

**Key points to say:** “Stateless firewall checks packets only, doesn’t remember connections.”

**Quick Comparison:**

| Feature             | Stateful        | Stateless  |
| ------------------- | --------------- | ---------- |
| Connection tracking | ✅               | ❌          |
| Return traffic      | Automatic       | Must allow |
| Performance         | Slightly slower | Faster     |
