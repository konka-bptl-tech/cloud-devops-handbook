## **Client Conversation Practice Sheet**

### **1. AWS Infrastructure Setup**

**Client:** “How will you set up our application on AWS?”
**You:** “I’ll use a three-tier architecture: frontend on S3 + CloudFront, backend on ECS with auto-scaling, database on RDS Multi-AZ. VPC, subnets, security groups, and route tables will secure networking. Monitoring with CloudWatch and logging with CloudWatch Logs or ELK.”

---

### **2. CI/CD Pipeline**

**Client:** “How will we automate deployments?”
**You:** “We’ll use GitHub Actions pipelines. Every push triggers tests, builds Docker images, and deploys to ECS/EKS. Staging environments ensure safe testing before production. Blue-green or rolling deployments prevent downtime.”

---

### **3. Kubernetes Migration**

**Client:** “Can you move our Docker containers to Kubernetes?”
**You:** “Yes. We’ll set up an EKS cluster and deploy apps using Helm charts. Istio will manage traffic and observability. Prometheus + Grafana monitors CPU, memory, and network metrics.”

---

### **4. Monitoring & Alerting**

**Client:** “How will we know if something goes wrong?”
**You:** “We’ll monitor metrics with Prometheus + Grafana, and logs with ELK or CloudWatch. Alerts can be sent via Slack, email, or PagerDuty for quick response.”

---

### **5. Cost Optimization**

**Client:** “How can we reduce AWS costs?”
**You:** “Use Reserved Instances or Savings Plans, auto-scaling to reduce idle resources, S3 lifecycle policies, and right-size instances. Cost Explorer tracks usage and identifies savings opportunities.”

---

### **6. Security**

**Client:** “How secure will our environment be?”
**You:** “IAM roles for EC2, security groups, encrypted RDS and S3, least privilege policies, and audit logging. CI/CD access is role-based. GuardDuty and CloudTrail monitor security events.”

---

### **7. Disaster Recovery**

**Client:** “What if production fails?”
**You:** “Multi-AZ or cross-region setups for critical resources, automated RDS snapshots, S3 replication. CI/CD pipelines allow quick redeployment of a working version.”

---

### **8. Application Scaling**

**Client:** “What if traffic spikes?”
**You:** “Auto-scaling for ECS/EKS based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics. Load balancers distribute traffic evenly. S3 + CloudFront scale automatically.”

---

### **9. Kubernetes Observability**

**Client:** “How do we monitor Kubernetes clusters?”
**You:** “Prometheus + Grafana for metrics, node-exporter for nodes, cAdvisor for containers. Fluentd or CloudWatch collects logs. Alerts notify teams on anomalies.”

---

### **10. Security Breach Detection**

**Client:** “How do we detect malicious activity?”
**You:** “Enable CloudTrail and GuardDuty to monitor API activity. Security groups and IAM policies follow least privilege. Alerts notify teams immediately.”

---

### **11. Terraform Infrastructure**

**Client:** “How will you manage infrastructure as code?”
**You:** “We’ll write Terraform modules for reusable code, maintain separate backends per environment, and manage variables using tfvars. This ensures version-controlled, consistent infrastructure.”

---

### **12. Database High Availability**

**Client:** “How will you make our database reliable?”
**You:** “RDS Multi-AZ ensures high availability. Automated backups, snapshots, and read replicas allow fast recovery and scaling.”

---

### **13. Logging Strategy**

**Client:** “How do we collect and analyze logs?”
**You:** “System and application logs go to ELK or CloudWatch. We can search, filter, and visualize logs in real-time. Alerts trigger for errors or anomalies.”

---

### **14. Docker Container Security**

**Client:** “How will you secure Docker containers?”
**You:** “Use minimal base images, scan images for vulnerabilities, set resource limits, use user namespaces, and restrict container privileges.”

---

### **15. Blue-Green Deployment**

**Client:** “How can we deploy without downtime?”
**You:** “Blue-green deployment maintains two environments. We switch traffic to the new environment only after successful testing, minimizing downtime.”

---

### **16. Serverless Integration**

**Client:** “Can we use Lambda for certain tasks?”
**You:** “Yes. Lambda can handle event-driven tasks like image processing or notifications. We can trigger it from S3, DynamoDB, or EventBridge.”

---

### **17. Networking Setup**

**Client:** “How will you configure networking?”
**You:** “VPC with public/private subnets, NAT gateways for private instances, route tables, security groups, and NACLs. Load balancers handle traffic routing, and Route 53 manages DNS.”

---

### **18. API Gateway**

**Client:** “Can we expose APIs securely?”
**You:** “Use API Gateway with Lambda or ECS backend. Enable authentication, throttling, logging, and WAF for security.”

---

### **19. Continuous Monitoring**

**Client:** “How do we ensure uptime?”
**You:** “We’ll use CloudWatch dashboards, Prometheus metrics, and Grafana alerts. Any threshold breaches trigger notifications to the operations team.”

---

### **20. Application Versioning**

**Client:** “How do we roll back if deployment fails?”
**You:** “CI/CD pipelines track versions. We can redeploy a previous stable version instantly. ECS and Kubernetes support rolling back to previous images or manifests.”

---

### **21. Infrastructure Updates**

**Client:** “How do we apply updates safely?”
**You:** “Terraform plan shows changes before applying. We test updates in staging environments first. Rolling updates in ECS/Kubernetes minimize service disruption.”

---

### **22. Compliance & Auditing**

**Client:** “How do we ensure compliance?”
**You:** “Enable CloudTrail, GuardDuty, and Config rules. Maintain logs for auditing, enforce IAM policies, and encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.”

---

### **23. CI/CD Testing**

**Client:** “How do we ensure code quality?”
**You:** “Integrate automated unit tests, integration tests, and static code analysis into the pipeline. Only tested code is deployed to production.”

---

### **24. Multi-Region Deployment**

**Client:** “Can our app be deployed in multiple regions?”
**You:** “Yes. We replicate databases, use cross-region S3 buckets, and deploy ECS/EKS clusters in multiple regions for redundancy and low latency.”

---

### **25. Logging & Metrics Integration**

**Client:** “Can we visualize application performance?”
**You:** “Prometheus collects metrics from containers and nodes. Grafana dashboards visualize performance trends. Alerts notify teams of performance degradation or errors.”

---

✅ **Tip:** Practice these by **reading the client’s question aloud, then answering in your own words**. After a few runs, you’ll sound natural and confident.
