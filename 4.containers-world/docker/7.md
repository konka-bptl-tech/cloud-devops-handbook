## üìù Docker Compose

### üîπ What is Docker Compose?

* **Docker Compose** is a tool to define and run **multi-container Docker applications**.
* Instead of starting containers one by one with `docker run`, you describe the entire setup in a single YAML file (`docker-compose.yml`).
* With one command (`docker-compose up`), Compose builds, runs, and connects all containers automatically.

---

### üîπ Why Use Docker Compose?

* Manage **multiple containers** as a single service.
* Define **networks, volumes, and environment variables** in one place.
* Easy to **share configurations** with your team (just send the YAML).
* Perfect for local development and testing microservices.

### üîπ Basic Structure of `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - ./html:/usr/share/nginx/html
  db:
    image: mysql:5.7
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/mysql

volumes:
  db_data:
```

* **services:** Define each container here.
* **image:** The image to use for the container.
* **ports:** Port mapping host\:container.
* **volumes:** Persistent storage.
* **environment:** Environment variables for the container.
* **networks (optional):** Define custom networks if needed.
