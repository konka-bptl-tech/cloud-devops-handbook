## 📝 Docker Volumes

### 🔹 What Are Volumes?

* **Volumes** are Docker’s preferred way to **store persistent data**.
* By default, data inside a container is **ephemeral** (lost when the container stops).
* Volumes let you **store data outside the container’s writable layer** so it persists even if the container is deleted or recreated.

### 🔹 Why Use Volumes?

* Persistent storage for databases, logs, configuration files.
* Share data between multiple containers.
* Decouple container lifecycle from data lifecycle.

### 🔹 Types of Volumes

| Type                 | Description                                                    |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Named Volume**     | Managed by Docker. Created with `docker volume create <name>`. |
| **Anonymous Volume** | Created automatically when you mount without a name.           |
| **Bind Mount**       | Directly maps a host directory or file into the container.     |

### 🔹 Basic Commands

```bash
docker volume create myvolume           # Create a volume
docker volume ls                        # List volumes
docker run -v myvolume:/data nginx       # Mount volume to /data in container
docker volume inspect myvolume          # Inspect volume details
docker volume rm myvolume               # Remove a volume
```

## 📝 Docker Networks

### 🔹 What Are Networks?

* Docker Networks allow **containers to communicate with each other** and with the outside world.
* By default, Docker creates some networks automatically.

### 🔹 Default Network Types

| Network Type         | Description                                                                         |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **bridge** (default) | Containers on the same bridge network can talk to each other using container names. |
| **host**             | Container shares the host’s network stack (no isolation).                           |
| **none**             | Completely isolated (no networking).                                                |

### 🔹 User-Defined Networks

* You can create custom networks to group containers together.
* Containers on the same user-defined network can communicate via their names.

### 🔹 Basic Commands

```bash
docker network ls                        # List networks
docker network create mynetwork          # Create a custom network
docker run -d --network=mynetwork nginx  # Run container on custom network
docker network inspect mynetwork         # View details of a network
docker network connect mynetwork mycontainer  # Connect existing container to a network
docker network disconnect mynetwork mycontainer  # Disconnect container from a network
docker network rm mynetwork              # Remove a network
```

### 🟦 In Simple Words

* **Volumes = Persistent Data Storage** (data survives container removal).
* **Networks = Container Communication** (containers talk to each other securely).
