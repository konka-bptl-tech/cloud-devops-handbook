## 📝 Namespaces & cGroups in Containers

### 🟦 Key Concept

* A **container** is essentially a **running process** on the host machine.
* The container stays alive **as long as the process runs**.
* When the process exits, the container stops.

---

### 🟦 How Containers Achieve Isolation

* Containers get:

  * Their own **hostname**
  * Their own **network stack**
  * Their own **process IDs (PID)**
* This separation happens because of **Linux Namespaces**.

### 🟦 Namespaces – Provide Isolation

Linux namespaces isolate resources at different levels:

| Namespace Type | What It Isolates                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pid`          | Process IDs (each container has its own PID tree)       |
| `net`          | Network interfaces, IP addresses, routing tables        |
| `mnt`          | Mount points (file systems)                             |
| `uts`          | Hostname & domain name                                  |
| `ipc`          | Interprocess communication (message queues, semaphores) |
| `user`         | User & group IDs inside the container                   |

🔹 This is how each container appears to have its own OS environment while actually sharing the host kernel.

### 🟦 cGroups – Control Resource Usage

* **cGroups (control groups)** manage and limit how much **CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network bandwidth** a container can use.
* This ensures:

  * Containers get enough compute resources to run properly.
  * One container cannot consume all system resources.

Example: Docker uses cGroups to enforce `--memory` and `--cpus` limits you set on a container.

---

### 🟦 In Simple Words

* **Namespaces = Isolation** (separate views of the system).
* **cGroups = Resource Control** (limit how much each container can use).
