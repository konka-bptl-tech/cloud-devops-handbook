Got it âœ… â€” youâ€™re asking about **types of Kubernetes Pod errors** (the different states / error categories a Pod can go into).
Iâ€™ll break it down simply for you:

---

### ðŸ”¹ 1. **Pod Status Errors (High-Level States)**

These are visible when you run `kubectl get pods`:

* **Pending** â€“ Pod canâ€™t be scheduled to a node (resource shortage, node selector mismatch, taints).
* **ContainerCreating** â€“ Pod is waiting while pulling the image or setting up volumes/network.
* **CrashLoopBackOff** â€“ Container keeps crashing and Kubernetes is retrying.
* **ImagePullBackOff / ErrImagePull** â€“ Image canâ€™t be pulled from registry (wrong image name, auth issue).
* **CreateContainerConfigError** â€“ Error in configuration (bad env, bad volume mount).
* **RunContainerError** â€“ Failure during container start.
* **Completed** â€“ Job/Pod finished successfully (not an error but a terminal state).

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Container-Level Errors (inside Pod)**

Youâ€™ll see these in `kubectl describe pod <pod>` or logs:

* **OOMKilled** â€“ Container killed because it exceeded memory limit.
* **Error / ExitCode != 0** â€“ Container exited with a non-zero code.
* **Back-off restarting failed container** â€“ Container is repeatedly failing.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. **Scheduling & Node-Level Issues**

* **NodeAffinity / Tolerations issues** â€“ Pod canâ€™t be scheduled because node doesnâ€™t match.
* **Insufficient CPU/Memory** â€“ No node has the requested resources.
* **Node not Ready / DiskPressure / NetworkUnavailable** â€“ Node conditions prevent scheduling.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 4. **Networking Errors**

* **DNS resolution failure** inside the Pod.
* **Service unreachable** (wrong Service selector or NetworkPolicy blocking traffic).

---

### ðŸ”¹ 5. **Volume / Storage Errors**

* **MountVolume.SetUp failed** â€“ PVC not bound, missing PV.
* **Permission denied** when mounting.
* **Read-only file system** â€“ Volume not writable.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 6. **Security Context / Policy Errors**

* Pod blocked by:

  * PodSecurityPolicy
  * AppArmor/SELinux profiles
  * RBAC misconfigurations for sidecars/inits.

---

### Quick Tip:

Run these to troubleshoot:

```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>      # Events & reasons
kubectl logs <pod-name>              # Logs of main container
kubectl logs <pod-name> -c <container-name>  # Logs of specific container
```

Would you like me to **make a table** of these Pod error types (Status, Possible Cause, Fix)?
Itâ€™ll be perfect for your `.md` notes.
