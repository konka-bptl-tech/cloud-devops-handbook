### ✅ **What are Probes in Kubernetes?**

Probes are **health checks** used by the Kubernetes **kubelet** to determine the state of a container.
They help Kubernetes **decide whether to restart a container, send traffic to it, or wait for it to be ready**.

---

### ✅ **Types of Probes**

#### 1. **Liveness Probe**

* **Purpose:** Checks if the container is still alive (running properly).
* **If it fails:** Kubernetes **restarts the container**.
* **Example Use:** Detects deadlocks (when the app runs but is stuck).
* **Example:**

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /healthz
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 5
```

➡ Kubernetes will hit `/healthz` every 5 seconds after 10s delay.
If it fails, container restarts.

---

#### 2. **Readiness Probe**

* **Purpose:** Checks if the container is **ready to accept traffic**.
* **If it fails:** The Pod is **removed from Service endpoints** (traffic won’t go to it).
* **Example:**

```yaml
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /ready
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 3
```

➡ The app is running but maybe still loading data or waiting for DB. Until it passes, **no traffic is sent**.

---

#### 3. **Startup Probe**

* **Purpose:** Used for **slow-starting applications**.
* **If it fails:** Container is killed.
* **Difference from Liveness:** It runs **only at the start** until it succeeds, then liveness takes over.
* **Example:**

```yaml
startupProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /startup
    port: 8080
  failureThreshold: 30
  periodSeconds: 10
```

➡ Allows the app **300 seconds (30 × 10)** to start before marking it as failed.

### ✅ **Why Do We Need All Three?**

* **Liveness** → Is the app still alive? (Restart if stuck)
* **Readiness** → Can the app handle traffic? (If not, remove from load balancer)
* **Startup** → Give slow apps more time to boot without failing liveness checks

---

### ✅ **Probe Types (for all three)**

* **httpGet:** HTTP endpoint check
* **tcpSocket:** TCP port check
* **exec:** Run a command inside the container

---

✅ **Best Practices**

* Use **liveness** for app health
* Use **readiness** for traffic control
* Use **startup** for apps with heavy initialization
* Don’t set too aggressive intervals (avoid unnecessary restarts)

✔ Or **a LinkedIn post idea explaining these three in simple language**?

---
Here’s a **complete YAML example** combining **liveness**, **readiness**, and **startup probes** for a real-world application like an **Nginx web server**:

---

### ✅ **Pod with All Three Probes**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: probe-demo
  labels:
    app: probe-demo
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80

    # ✅ Startup Probe (for slow-start apps)
    startupProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /index.html
        port: 80
      failureThreshold: 30   # Try 30 times before failing
      periodSeconds: 10      # Every 10 seconds (total 300 sec)

    # ✅ Liveness Probe (is the app alive?)
    livenessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /index.html
        port: 80
      initialDelaySeconds: 10  # Start after 10 sec
      periodSeconds: 5         # Check every 5 sec
      failureThreshold: 3      # Restart if fails 3 times

    # ✅ Readiness Probe (ready to accept traffic?)
    readinessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /index.html
        port: 80
      initialDelaySeconds: 5   # Start after 5 sec
      periodSeconds: 3         # Check every 3 sec
      failureThreshold: 3      # Remove from LB if fails 3 times
```

### ✅ **How It Works**

1. **Startup Probe** runs first → waits up to **5 minutes (30 × 10)** for app startup before considering it failed.
2. Once startup probe **succeeds**, Kubernetes starts **liveness** and **readiness** probes.
3. **Liveness Probe** ensures app is healthy → restarts container if check fails.
4. **Readiness Probe** controls traffic → if it fails, pod is removed from service load balancer but **not restarted**.

---

✅ **Best Use Case:**

* **Startup Probe** → For apps like **Java Spring Boot**, which take time to initialize.
* **Readiness Probe** → Ensures traffic only goes when app is ready.
* **Liveness Probe** → Detects app crashes or deadlocks.
