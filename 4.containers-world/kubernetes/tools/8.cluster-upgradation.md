Ensure while upgrading cluster downtime must be 0 make sure changes in firewalls so that other teams can't connect to cluster we make sure no new releases happen while upgrading is going on 

Blue Green is a zero downtime deployment strategy where we create the same capacity of infra test it and switch the infra 

Announce downtime while platform upgrade 
Platform upgrade can be done nearly once
Take 3 hours of downtime 
1. EKS Control plane and NG fully functional
  EKS is an platform
2. Create new NG called as Green with Same capacity as Blue NG Taint the new NodeGroup 
3. Upgrade Control Plane first 1.33
4. New NG also should be upgraded to same 1.33 Old node group is still in 1.32
5. Cordon Ond Nodes Untaint the NG
6. Start drainning the nodes Workloads shift to new NG
7. Delete the old NG and manually edit the control plane 1.33
8. Create Firewalls back and announce upgrade is completed ask app team to check their applications

Rolling Update 
- Gradually release new application
- for example version 1.22 pods are 4 and trying release application 1.23 in rolling update
- then deployment controller
   create 1.24 pod and delete old 1.23 pod same way this process continued old one is replaced by new one
This approach at the same time users may see 2 diff versions but code should handle this 

Blue-Green VM 
--------------
LB --> Listner ---> Rule ---> TG ---> VM

Present Blue TG is running Create new Green TG add the nodes to this

Create new internal LB attach listner Rules and new TG

Test the application with internal URL basic sanity test[basic functionality testing]

Edit main LB rule to send traffic to new TG

We can remove old TG but let's keep it as backup/rollback

Secret was upgraded so those changes automatically replicated to pod usually we to restart the pod 
we have another option eks secret rotation drivers
