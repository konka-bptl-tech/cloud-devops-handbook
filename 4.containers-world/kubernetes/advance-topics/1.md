### âœ… **What is a Pod Disruption Budget (PDB)?**

A **PDB** in Kubernetes defines the **minimum number of Pods that must remain running during a voluntary disruption** (like a node drain, upgrade, or cluster maintenance).

It **prevents too many Pods of the same application from going down at the same time**.

---

### âœ… **Why do we need PDB?**

* When a node is drained for maintenance, all Pods on that node are evicted.
* Without PDB, Kubernetes might evict too many Pods of a Deployment or StatefulSet at once, causing downtime.
* PDB ensures **high availability** during disruptions.

---

### âœ… **Where it applies**

* **Voluntary disruptions** (node drain, rolling upgrade)
* **Not for involuntary disruptions** (node crash, hardware failure)

---

### âœ… **Key Settings**

* `minAvailable` â†’ Minimum number of Pods that should stay up.
* `maxUnavailable` â†’ Maximum number of Pods that can be down.

---

### âœ… **Example**

Suppose you have 5 Pods in a Deployment:

* If `minAvailable: 3`, at least 3 Pods must be running at all times.
* If `maxUnavailable: 1`, only 1 Pod can be down at a time.

---

### âœ… **YAML Example**

```yaml
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: my-app-pdb
spec:
  minAvailable: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
```

**What happens?**

* If you have 3 Pods and drain a node, Kubernetes will only evict Pods one at a time so that at least 2 remain running.

---

âœ… **In short:**
PDB helps maintain application availability during maintenance by controlling how many Pods can be disrupted at the same time.

âœ” **Real-world use cases** of PDB in **production clusters**
âœ” **Difference between PDB and HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)**

```css
[Node 1]    [Node 2]    [Node 3]
  Pod A       Pod B       Pod C
       PDB: minAvailable=2
```
When Node 1 is drained â†’ only Pod A is evicted because 2 Pods must stay running.

âœ… How: You define:

- minAvailable â†’ Minimum Pods that must stay running

- maxUnavailable â†’ Maximum Pods allowed to go down

```yaml
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: my-app-pdb
spec:
  minAvailable: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
```
