## **ðŸ“Œ What is a Process in Linux?**

A **process** is an **instance of a running program** that the Linux kernel manages. It consists of:

* **Executable code** (program instructions)
* **Allocated resources**:

  * **CPU time**
  * **Memory (RAM)**
  * **I/O (files, sockets, network)**
* **Metadata**:

  * **PID** (Process ID)
  * **PPID** (Parent Process ID)
  * **State** (Running, Sleeping, Stopped, Zombie)
  * **User/Group ownership**
  * **Priority and Scheduling info**

âœ… In simple terms:
A process is a **program in execution with its own resources**, managed by the **Linux kernel**.

---

## **ðŸ“Œ Difference Between Program, Process, and Thread**

* **Program** â†’ Static code stored on disk (e.g., `/usr/bin/python`).
* **Process** â†’ Program loaded into memory and running (with PID).
* **Thread** â†’ A lightweight execution unit inside a process that shares memory and resources.

---

## **ðŸ“Œ Process Types**

* **Foreground process** â†’ Runs in the terminal, interactive.
* **Background process** â†’ Runs without terminal interaction (`&`).
* **Daemon** â†’ Long-running background service (e.g., `sshd`).

---

## **ðŸ“Œ Key Directories**

* `/proc/<PID>/` â†’ Process details.
* `/proc/cpuinfo` â†’ CPU details.
* `/proc/meminfo` â†’ Memory details.

kill -9 <PID>        # Force kill (SIGKILL)
killall <name>       # Kill all processes by name
pkill <pattern>      # Kill by pattern
```

---

### **Foreground & Background Jobs**

```bash
command &            # Run in background
jobs                 # List background jobs
fg %1               # Bring job 1 to foreground
bg %1               # Resume job 1 in background
disown              # Remove from shell job table
```

---

### **Long-Running Processes**

```bash
nohup command &      # Run without hang-up
setsid command       # Start new session for process
```

---

### **Check Process Info**

```bash
cat /proc/<PID>/status    # Detailed info
ls /proc/<PID>/fd         # Open file descriptors
```

---

### **Priority Management**

```bash
nice -n 10 command        # Start process with lower priority
renice -n 5 -p <PID>      # Change running process priority
```

**Range:** `-20` (highest) to `+19` (lowest)

---

### **Resource Usage**

```bash
ps aux --sort=-%cpu       # Sort by CPU usage
ps aux --sort=-%mem       # Sort by memory usage
top, htop                 # Real-time CPU/Memory
```

---

### **Process Tree**

```bash
pstree                   # Show process hierarchy
```

---

### **Scheduling**

```bash
at 10:30 "command"       # Run once at 10:30
cron                     # Repeat jobs
systemd timers           # Advanced scheduling
```

---

# âœ… **Security Tips for Process Management**

âœ” Use **ulimit** to restrict process resources:

```bash
ulimit -u 1000       # Max number of processes
ulimit -n 1024       # Max open files
```

âœ” Run processes as **non-root users**
âœ” Use **cgroups** for CPU & memory limits
âœ” Use `NoNewPrivileges=true` in systemd for security

Sure, Konka! Letâ€™s explain the **`uptime`** command clearly.

---

# **`uptime` Command**

### **Definition**

* `uptime` shows **how long the system has been running** since last boot.
* Also displays **current time, number of users, and system load averages**.

---

### **Basic Syntax**

```bash
uptime
```

---

### **Example Output**

```bash
04:30:12 up 5 days,  3:45,  2 users,  load average: 0.15, 0.10, 0.05
```

**Explanation:**

* `04:30:12` â†’ Current system time
* `up 5 days, 3:45` â†’ System uptime (5 days, 3 hours 45 minutes)
* `2 users` â†’ Number of users currently logged in
* `load average: 0.15, 0.10, 0.05` â†’ System load averages for **1, 5, and 15 minutes**

---

### **Optional Flags**

* `-p` â†’ Pretty format

```bash
uptime -p
# up 5 days, 3 hours, 45 minutes
```

* `-s` â†’ Show when the system was **last booted**

```bash
uptime -s
# 2025-09-25 01:00:00
```

---

### **Use Cases**
