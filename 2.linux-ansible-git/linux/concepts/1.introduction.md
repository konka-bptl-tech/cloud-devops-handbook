# 1. OS

* The OS **manages hardware resources** (CPU, memory, storage, I/O devices).
* It **provides an interface** for programs to interact with hardware without dealing with the complexity directly.

* Simply OS = resource manager + hardware interface for applications.

# Linux & Windows

**Linux:**

* Linux is an **open-source operating system**.
* It’s **free** to use, modify, and distribute.
* Commonly used for **servers, cloud, and development environments**.
* Examples of Linux distributions: Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian.

**Windows:**

* Windows is a **proprietary operating system** developed by Microsoft.
* You need a **license** to use it.
* Commonly used for **desktops, laptops, and some servers**.
* Examples: Windows 10, Windows 11, Windows Server.

**In short:**

* Linux = free, open-source OS, mostly for servers and development.
* Windows = paid OS, mostly for desktops and user-friendly environments.

# 2. Kernel & Features

* The kernel is the **core part of an operating system**.
* It **manages hardware resources** like CPU, memory, and devices.
* It acts as a **bridge between applications and hardware**, letting programs use the hardware safely.

**Features of an OS (Linux or Windows):**

1. **Process Management** – Runs and manages multiple programs at the same time.
2. **Memory Management** – Controls how memory is allocated and used.
3. **File System Management** – Organizes and manages files on storage devices.
4. **Device Management** – Communicates with hardware devices like printers, disks, and keyboards.
5. **Security & Access Control** – Protects data and restricts unauthorized access.
6. **User Interface** – Provides a way for users to interact with the system (GUI or CLI).

**In short:**

* **Kernel = core that talks to hardware**
* **OS Features = tools that make using the computer easy and safe**

# 3. Command 

* In computing, a **command is basically an instruction** you give to the operating system to **perform a specific task**.
* Examples:

  * `ls` → Instruction to **list files** in a directory
  * `mkdir new_folder` → Instruction to **create a folder**
  * `ping google.com` → Instruction to **check connectivity**

**Command = Instruction for the OS to perform a task**

# 4. Shell

* A **shell** is a **program that takes commands from the user and tells the OS what to do**.
* It acts as an **interface between the user and the Linux kernel**.
* Also validates the commands

Commands = Instructions

**What it does:**

1. **Command Execution** – Runs commands you type.
2. **Script Execution** – Runs shell scripts to automate tasks.
3. **Program Launching** – Starts applications or programs.
4. **File & Process Management** – Lets you create, delete, and manage files and processes.

**Types of Shell in Linux:**

1. **Bash (Bourne Again Shell)** – Most common, default in many Linux systems.
2. **Sh (Bourne Shell)** – Older version, simple and basic.
3. **Csh (C Shell)** – Syntax similar to C programming.
4. **Ksh (Korn Shell)** – Combines features of Sh and Csh.
5. **Zsh (Z Shell)** – Advanced features, improved usability.

**What happens when you type a command in Linux**

1. **User types a command** in the shell (e.g., `ls`).
2. **Shell reads the command** and interprets it.
3. **Shell searches for the command** in directories listed in the `PATH` variable.
4. **Shell tells the kernel to execute the command**.
5. **Kernel executes the command** using system resources (CPU, memory, I/O).
6. **Kernel returns the output** to the shell.
7. **Shell displays the output** on your terminal.

* **Shell = command interpreter + interface to kernel**

* Different shells = different ways to interact with Linux.

[Shell] – Takes your command and interprets it
   │

[Command Type?] ──────────────┐
   │                          │
   ▼                          ▼
[Binary Command]            [High-level Script]
(already compiled)          (needs interpreter/compiler)

   ▼                          ▼
[Kernel] – Loads program into memory and executes it
   │
   ▼
[CPU] – Executes machine code (1’s and 0’s)
   │
   ▼
[Output] – Displayed on your terminal
```

**Explanation in simple terms:**

1. **You type a command** → Shell reads it.
2. **Shell decides** if it’s built-in, binary, or a script.
3. **Shell calls the kernel** to execute it.
4. **Kernel loads the program into CPU** → CPU executes machine code.
5. **Output is sent back** to the shell and displayed to you.

# 5. Terminal

* A **terminal** is a **program or interface that lets you type commands to communicate with the shell**.
* It is basically a **text-based interface** to interact with the operating system.

**What it does:**

1. Lets you **type commands**.
2. Shows **output or results** of commands.
3. Provides a way to **run scripts, programs, and manage files**.

**Examples of terminals:**

* Linux: **GNOME Terminal, Konsole, xterm**
* Windows: **Command Prompt (CMD), PowerShell, Windows Terminal**

**In short:**

* **Terminal = input/output interface for the shell**

* **Shell = what interprets and runs your commands**

✅ So, the **terminal is like the window**, and the **shell is the engine behind the window** that actually does the work.
