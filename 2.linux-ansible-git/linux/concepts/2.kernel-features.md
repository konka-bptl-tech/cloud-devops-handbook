## **2. Kernel & Features**

### **1. Linux Kernel Basics**

* The **kernel** is the **core part of Linux OS**.
* It manages **hardware resources** (CPU, memory, devices, storage).
* Provides a safe way for **applications (user programs) to interact with hardware**.
* Without the kernel, applications would have to talk to hardware directly (which is unsafe and complex).

---

### **2. Kernel Space vs User Space**

* **Kernel Space**:

  * Where the kernel code runs.
  * Has **full access** to hardware (privileged mode).
  * Runs drivers, process scheduling, memory management, etc.
* **User Space**:

  * Where applications run (like `ls`, `vim`, browsers).
  * Has **restricted access** (canâ€™t directly talk to hardware).
  * Must send requests to the kernel using **system calls**.

ðŸ‘‰ Think of it as:

* **User Space = apps & programs**
* **Kernel Space = boss that controls hardware**

### **3. Boot Process Overview**

The Linux boot process usually goes like this:

1. **BIOS/UEFI**

   * Firmware on the motherboard.
   * Runs hardware checks (POST) and looks for a bootloader in storage.

2. **Bootloader (GRUB)**

   * GRUB = **GRand Unified Bootloader**.
   * Loads the Linux kernel into memory.

3. **Kernel**

   * Initializes hardware drivers, memory, CPU scheduling.
   * Mounts the root filesystem.
   * Starts the first process (`init` or `systemd`).

4. **Init/systemd**

   * Initializes user space.
   * Starts background services (network, logging, etc.).
   * Finally shows you a login prompt or GUI.

---

### **4. Init vs systemd**

* **Init (SysV init):**

  * The **traditional first process** in Linux.
  * Uses **scripts (in /etc/init.d/)** to start services one by one.
  * Slower because it runs tasks sequentially.

* **systemd:**

  * Modern replacement for init.
  * Starts services **in parallel** â†’ much faster boot.
  * Uses **unit files (.service, .target)** instead of init scripts.
  * Has built-in tools for logging (`journald`), dependency handling, and service management.

ðŸ‘‰ Most modern Linux distros use **systemd** instead of old init.

---

âœ… **In short:**

* Kernel = core, manages hardware.
* Kernel Space = privileged mode, User Space = restricted apps.
* Boot process = BIOS â†’ GRUB â†’ Kernel â†’ Init/systemd.
* Init = old, slow; systemd = modern, fast, feature-rich.

## **5. Profile Files**

### **What are profile files?**

* **Profile files are shell startup configuration files.**
* They run automatically when a user logs in or starts a shell session.
* They set up **environment variables, PATH, aliases, functions, and shell behavior**.

---

### **Types of Profile Files**

There are **two categories**:

#### **1. System-wide profile files** (apply to all users)

* Located in `/etc/` directory.
* Examples:

  * `/etc/profile` â†’ executed at login by all Bourne-compatible shells (sh, bash, ksh).
  * `/etc/bashrc` or `/etc/bash.bashrc` â†’ executed for interactive non-login shells.

#### **2. User-specific profile files** (apply only to that user)

* Located in the userâ€™s **home directory** (`~`).
* Examples:

  * `~/.bash_profile` â†’ executed for login shells (bash).
  * `~/.profile` â†’ executed if `~/.bash_profile` is not found.
  * `~/.bashrc` â†’ executed for every new interactive shell.
  * `~/.bash_logout` â†’ executed when the user logs out.

---

### **When they run?**

1. **Login shell (first login via terminal/ssh):**

   * Runs `/etc/profile` â†’ then `~/.bash_profile` (or `~/.profile`).

2. **Non-login shell (open a new terminal window/tab):**

   * Runs `~/.bashrc`.

3. **Logout:**

   * Runs `~/.bash_logout`.

---

### **Why are profile files important?**

* Define environment variables (e.g., `PATH`, `JAVA_HOME`).
* Add shortcuts/aliases (e.g., `alias ll='ls -l'`).
* Set shell prompt (`PS1`).
* Customize user environment (history size, editor, etc.).

---

âœ… **In short:**

* **Profile files = shell startup scripts.**
* **System-wide** in `/etc/`, **user-specific** in `~/`.
* Control environment variables, aliases, and login/logout behavior.
