## 1. Git Introduction

### Git

* **Git:** Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) to **track changes in code**, collaborate, and manage multiple versions.
* **Key Feature:** Each developer has a **full copy of the repository** locally.

### VCS vs DVCS

| Feature            | VCS (Centralized)      | DVCS (Git)                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Repository         | Single central repo    | Full copy for every developer |
| Network dependency | Must connect to server | Can work offline              |
| History            | Stored on server       | Stored locally + server       |
| Collaboration      | Push/Pull to server    | Push/Pull + local commits     |
| Examples           | SVN, CVS               | Git, Mercurial                |

**Easy way to say:**

* **VCS = central repo, always online**
* **DVCS = local + central, can work offline**

## 2. Git Basic Configuration

### Purpose

* Set up **user identity, editor, and preferences** for commits and Git operations.

### Commands

```bash
# Set username
git config --global user.name "Your Name"

# Set email
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"

# Set default editor
git config --global core.editor "vim"

# View current config
git config --list
```

**Key Points:**

* `--global` → applies for all repos on your machine
* Without `--global` → applies only to the current repository
* Required for **commits to show correct author info**

---

**Easy way to explain in interview:**

* “Git config sets **username, email, and editor**, so commits are tracked with proper identity.”
