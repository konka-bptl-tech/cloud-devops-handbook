## Git Revert

* **Definition:** Undo changes by creating a **new commit** that reverses the effects of a previous commit.
* **Safe for shared repos** because history is **not rewritten**.
* **Command:**

```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
```

* **Use case:** Undo a commit in **main or shared branch** without affecting others’ work.

---

## Git Reset

* **Definition:** Undo commits and optionally **remove changes from staging or working directory**.
* **Rewrites history**, so risky in shared branches.
* **Types:**

  * `--soft` → undo commit, keep staged changes
  * `--mixed` → undo commit, unstage changes (default)
  * `--hard` → undo commit, discard changes completely
* **Command:**

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

* **Use case:** Undo **local commits** before pushing to remote.

### Key Differences

| Feature      | Git Revert                         | Git Reset                                 |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **History**  | Preserves history, adds new commit | Rewrites history                          |
| **Safety**   | Safe for shared repos              | Risky for shared repos                    |
| **Effect**   | Creates opposite commit            | Moves branch pointer, may discard changes |
| **Use Case** | Undo commit in shared branch       | Undo local commits before push            |

**Easy way to say in interview:**

* **Revert = safe undo with new commit**
* **Reset = local undo, rewrites history, risky for shared branches**

---
Here’s a **simple ASCII visual** showing **Git Revert vs Git Reset** for interview explanation:

---

### Scenario: Last two commits on `main`

```
Commit History:
o---o---A---B   (HEAD)
```

---

### 1. Git Revert

* Command: `git revert B`
* **Effect:** Creates a new commit `B'` that **undoes B**

```
o---o---A---B---B'   (HEAD)
```

* **Key point:** History preserved, safe for shared branches

---

### 2. Git Reset

* Command: `git reset --hard HEAD~1`
* **Effect:** Removes commit `B` and moves HEAD back

```
o---o---A   (HEAD)
```

* **Key point:** History rewritten, changes discarded if `--hard`, risky on shared branches

---

**Memory Tip for Interviews:**

* **Revert → safe undo, adds new commit**
* **Reset → local undo, rewrites history**
