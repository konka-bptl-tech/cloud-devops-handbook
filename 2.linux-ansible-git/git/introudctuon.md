Here’s a simple explanation:

### **Version Control System (VCS):**

* A tool that keeps track of changes in your files (mainly code).
* It allows you to **go back to previous versions**, **see who changed what**, and **work on the same project without overwriting others’ work**.
* Example: **Centralized VCS like SVN** – all code is stored in a **central server**, and developers pull/push changes from there.

---

### **Distributed Version Control System (DVCS):**

* Similar to VCS but **every developer has a full copy of the entire repository (including history)** on their local machine.
* You can **work offline**, commit locally, and later sync with others.
* Example: **Git** – you have your local repository, and there’s also a remote repository (like GitHub).

---

✅ **Main difference:**

* **Centralized VCS** → Only one central copy exists; you need the server for most actions.
* **Distributed VCS** → Every developer has the complete history; you can work offline and then sync.
