### 1. **Definition**

* Infrastructure is a collection of **hardware, software, network resources, and services** that provide the environment for running applications.
* Simply put, it’s everything that **supports your applications and users**.

---

### 2. **Components of Infrastructure**

1. **Compute** – Servers, virtual machines (VMs), containers, or serverless functions that run applications.
2. **Network** – Routers, switches, firewalls, load balancers, and IP addressing that connect resources and users.
3. **Storage** – Disks, databases, object storage (S3), or file systems to store data.
4. **Security & Access Management** – Firewalls, IAM, encryption, VPNs to protect resources.
5. **Monitoring & Logging** – Tools to track performance, availability, and errors.

---

### 3. **Types of Infrastructure**

1. **On-Premises (Traditional)** – Physical servers and network hardware located in your own data center.
2. **Cloud Infrastructure** – Virtualized resources provided by cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP).
3. **Hybrid** – A mix of on-premises and cloud infrastructure.

---

### Example:

* A web application might use:

  * **Compute:** EC2 instances or ECS containers
  * **Network:** VPC, subnets, ALB
  * **Storage:** RDS database + S3 bucket
  * **Security:** Security groups, IAM roles
  * **Monitoring:** CloudWatch

## **1. What is Infrastructure**

Infrastructure is the **foundation that supports applications and services**. It includes all **hardware, software, network, storage, and security components** required to run and manage systems.

**Components of Infrastructure:**

* **Compute:** Servers, VMs, containers, serverless
* **Network:** Routers, switches, firewalls, load balancers
* **Storage:** Databases, disks, object storage
* **Security:** IAM, firewalls, encryption
* **Monitoring:** Logs, metrics, alerts

---

## **2. Problems Before IaC**

Before Infrastructure as Code (IaC), infrastructure was **manual**:

* Manual server provisioning and configuration
* High chance of human error
* Inconsistent environments across dev, test, and prod
* Difficult to track changes and version infrastructure
* Time-consuming scaling and replication

---

## **3. After IaC**

With IaC tools (like Terraform, Ansible, CloudFormation):

* Infrastructure can be **automated and versioned**
* Consistent environments across all stages
* Faster provisioning and scaling
* Changes can be tracked in version control
* Reduced human errors and better reproducibility

---

## **4. Terraform as IaC & Its Benefits**

**Terraform** is an IaC tool that lets you **define infrastructure as code** using declarative configuration files.

**Benefits:**

* **Automation:** Create, update, and destroy resources automatically
* **Versioning:** Infrastructure definitions can be stored in Git
* **Reusability:** Modules allow reusable infrastructure components
* **Consistency:** Same configuration applies across dev, staging, prod
* **Multi-Cloud:** Works with AWS, Azure, GCP, and more
* **State Management:** Tracks deployed resources and dependencies

---

## **3. Terraform Introduction**

### **1. What is Terraform**

* Terraform is an **open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool** by HashiCorp.
* It allows you to **define, provision, and manage cloud and on-premises resources** using declarative configuration files.
* You write code to **create, update, and destroy infrastructure**, making it **automated, consistent, and reproducible**.

---

### **2. Terraform Architecture**

Terraform has three main components:

1. **CLI (Command Line Interface)**

   * The interface you use to run commands like `init`, `plan`, `apply`, and `destroy`.

2. **Provider**

   * Providers are plugins that **interact with cloud platforms or services** (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes).
   * They translate Terraform code into API calls to create resources.

3. **State**

   * Terraform maintains a **state file** to track resources it manages.
   * State allows Terraform to know **what exists, what changed, and what needs updating**.

### **3. Terraform vs Other IaC Tools**

| Feature              | Terraform                         | CloudFormation | Ansible            | Pulumi                    |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| **Type**             | Declarative                       | Declarative    | Procedural         | Declarative/Imperative    |
| **Multi-cloud**      | Yes                               | AWS only       | Yes                | Yes                       |
| **State Management** | Yes                               | Yes            | No                 | Yes                       |
| **Provisioning**     | Creates/Updates/Deletes resources | AWS only       | Configures OS/Apps | Creates/Updates resources |
| **Language**         | HCL (HashiCorp Config Language)   | JSON/YAML      | YAML               | TypeScript/Python/etc.    |

**Key points:**

* Terraform is **multi-cloud**, declarative, and tracks **state**.
* Unlike Ansible, Terraform focuses on **infrastructure provisioning**, not application configuration.
* Compared to CloudFormation, Terraform is **cloud-agnostic**, supporting AWS, Azure, GCP, and many other platforms.
