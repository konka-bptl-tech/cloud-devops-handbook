## üß† Terraform Commands ‚Äì Hands-On Scenarios

### **1. You modified a resource manually in AWS. How do you make Terraform reflect the real state?**

**Problem:** State file is outdated (drift).
**Solution:**

```bash
terraform refresh
terraform plan
```

**Explanation:**
`terraform refresh` updates the local state file with real infrastructure data ‚Äî it won‚Äôt change actual resources.

---

### **2. You want to recreate only one EC2 instance without touching others.**

**Solution 1 (Mark for recreation):**

```bash
terraform taint aws_instance.app_server
terraform apply
```

**Solution 2 (Target apply):**

```bash
terraform apply -target=aws_instance.app_server
```

**Interview Tip:**
Use `taint` if you want Terraform to delete & recreate a resource during apply.
Use `-target` when you want to apply or destroy a specific resource only.

---

### **3. You added new resources but provider plugins are old.**

**Solution:**

```bash
terraform init -upgrade
```

**Explanation:**
This re-downloads the latest provider versions and upgrades dependencies.

---

### **4. You need to check all resources currently tracked by Terraform.**

**Solution:**

```bash
terraform state list
```

**Extra:**
Use `terraform state show <resource>` to inspect a specific one.

---

### **5. You deleted an AWS resource manually, but it still shows in Terraform state.**

**Solution:**

```bash
terraform state rm aws_s3_bucket.demo
```

**Explanation:**
Removes resource from Terraform tracking without deleting anything in the cloud.

---

### **6. You migrated a resource from one module to another.**

**Solution:**

```bash
terraform state mv 'module.old.aws_instance.web' 'module.new.aws_instance.web'
```

**Explanation:**
Keeps the state consistent during refactoring.

---

### **7. You want to import an existing AWS resource into Terraform.**

**Solution:**

```bash
terraform import aws_s3_bucket.demo demo-bucket
```

**Steps:**

1. Create resource block in `.tf` file (no apply yet).
2. Run import command.
3. Run `terraform plan` to verify state alignment.

---

### **8. You want to visualize resource dependencies.**

**Solution:**

```bash
terraform graph | dot -Tpng > graph.png
```

**Explanation:**
Generates a graph of how your resources depend on each other (uses Graphviz).

---

### **9. You want to validate and format all Terraform files before pushing to GitHub.**

**Solution:**

```bash
terraform validate
terraform fmt -recursive
```

**Tip:**
These are great to include in CI/CD pipelines.

---

### **10. You want to debug why Terraform apply is failing.**

**Solution:**

```bash
export TF_LOG=DEBUG
export TF_LOG_PATH=./terraform.log
terraform apply
```

**Explanation:**
Logs all backend and provider interactions ‚Äî useful for troubleshooting.

---

### **11. You only want to see output values like instance IP or DB endpoint.**

**Solution:**

```bash
terraform output
terraform output db_endpoint
```

**Use case:**
CI/CD pipelines often use these outputs for deployments or notifications.

---

### **12. You want to destroy everything but confirm changes before.**

**Solution:**

```bash
terraform plan -destroy
terraform destroy
```

**Explanation:**
`plan -destroy` previews what will be deleted ‚Äî safer for production.

---

### **13. You want to apply changes only for one module (e.g., VPC).**

**Solution:**

```bash
terraform apply -target=module.vpc
```

**Tip:**
Use carefully ‚Äî it skips dependency checks.

---

### **14. You want to format and clean your Terraform code base automatically.**

**Solution:**

```bash
terraform fmt -recursive
```

**Optional in CI/CD:**
Add it to pre-commit hook or GitHub Action.

---

### **15. You want to know the difference between `refresh` and `plan`.**

| Command             | Purpose                                                         |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `terraform refresh` | Syncs **state file** with real infra (no plan or apply).        |
| `terraform plan`    | Shows **differences** between desired (code) and current state. |
| Combined usage      | `terraform refresh && terraform plan` = full drift detection.   |

---

## üß© Terraform Real-World Scenarios (Set 3 ‚Äì Advanced)

---

### **31. You have multiple environments (dev, stage, prod). How do you manage them efficiently?**

**Problem:**
You don‚Äôt want to duplicate `.tf` files for every environment.

**Solution Options:**

1. **Workspaces:**

   ```bash
   terraform workspace new dev
   terraform workspace select prod
   ```

   Variables change per workspace.

2. **Separate tfvars files:**

   ```
   terraform apply -var-file=dev.tfvars
   terraform apply -var-file=prod.tfvars
   ```

3. **Terragrunt:**

   ```hcl
   include { path = find_in_parent_folders() }
   terraform {
     source = "../modules/vpc"
   }
   inputs = {
     environment = "prod"
   }
   ```

**Best Practice:**
Use Terragrunt for environment separation and DRY (Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself) architecture.

---

### **32. You got a ‚Äústate lock already held‚Äù error during apply. What do you do?**

**Problem:**
Terraform is locked because of an incomplete or failed operation.

**Solution:**

* If using DynamoDB (S3 backend):

  ```bash
  terraform force-unlock <LOCK_ID>
  ```
* Find the lock ID from the error message.

**Tip:**
Never force unlock if another apply is still running.

---

### **33. You want to automatically trigger Terraform apply after merging code to `main` branch.**

**Solution:**
Use a **CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions / Jenkins)**:

```yaml
jobs:
  terraform:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Terraform
        uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2
      - run: terraform init
      - run: terraform plan
      - run: terraform apply -auto-approve
```

**Explanation:**
Integrates Terraform into your DevOps workflow for automation.

---

### **34. You want to share Terraform modules across your team with versioning.**

**Solution:**
Publish modules to **Terraform Registry** or **private Git repository**:

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source  = "git::https://github.com/konka/modules.git//vpc?ref=v1.0.2"
}
```

**Explanation:**
Version control helps you track and roll back module updates easily.

---

### **35. You want to upgrade a Terraform provider version safely.**

**Solution:**

1. Update version constraint:

   ```hcl
   required_providers {
     aws = {
       source  = "hashicorp/aws"
       version = "~> 5.0"
     }
   }
   ```
2. Run:

   ```bash
   terraform init -upgrade
   terraform plan
   ```
3. Review plan before applying.

**Explanation:**
The `~>` operator ensures safe minor upgrades.

---

### **36. You changed a Terraform module, but nothing changes after apply.**

**Possible causes:**

* Module version not bumped (cached version used)
* Missing `terraform init -upgrade`
* Variables not connected properly

**Solution:**

```bash
terraform init -upgrade
terraform plan
```

**Tip:**
Always bump module version or use `-upgrade` to fetch new code.

---

### **37. You‚Äôre getting ‚Äúresource already exists‚Äù error during apply.**

**Problem:**
Terraform tries to create a resource that already exists in the cloud.

**Solution:**

1. Import it:

   ```bash
   terraform import aws_s3_bucket.logs konka-logs
   ```
2. Then run:

   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

**Explanation:**
Import brings existing resources under Terraform management.

---

### **38. You‚Äôre migrating Terraform state from local to remote backend.**

**Solution:**

```bash
terraform init -migrate-state
```

**Explanation:**
This moves your existing `terraform.tfstate` to the remote backend (like S3).

---

### **39. You want to automatically format and validate Terraform files during every commit.**

**Solution:**
Add a **pre-commit hook**:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/antonbabenko/pre-commit-terraform
    rev: v1.78.0
    hooks:
      - id: terraform_fmt
      - id: terraform_validate
```

**Explanation:**
Ensures Terraform code is clean and valid before it reaches Git.

---

### **40. You need to use outputs from one Terraform project in another (e.g., VPC ‚Üí EKS).**

**Solution:**

* Export outputs from Project A to S3 or Terraform Cloud.
* Use `terraform_remote_state` in Project B:

  ```hcl
  data "terraform_remote_state" "vpc" {
    backend = "s3"
    config = {
      bucket = "konka-tf-state"
      key    = "vpc/terraform.tfstate"
      region = "ap-south-1"
    }
  }

  resource "aws_eks_cluster" "main" {
    vpc_config {
      subnet_ids = data.terraform_remote_state.vpc.outputs.subnet_ids
    }
  }
  ```

**Explanation:**
Enables sharing outputs across separate projects.

---

### **41. Your Terraform plan output is too long. You want only the changes summary.**

**Solution:**

```bash
terraform plan -no-color | grep "Plan:"
```

**Output Example:**
`Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.`

**Explanation:**
Useful in CI pipelines for clean summaries.

---

### **42. You want to enforce tagging standards across all AWS resources.**

**Solution:**
Use **Sentinel Policies** in Terraform Cloud or **OPA** with custom rules.

Example Sentinel Policy:

```hcl
import "tfplan"

main = rule {
  all tfplan.resource_changes as _, rc {
    all rc.change.after.tags as _, tag {
      tag.key matches "^env|owner|cost_center$"
    }
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**
Prevents apply unless all resources are properly tagged.

---

### **43. Your Terraform state got accidentally deleted. How do you recover?**

**Solution:**

* If using **S3 backend**: restore from versioned S3 object.
* If local: recover from `.terraform.tfstate.backup`

  ```bash
  cp terraform.tfstate.backup terraform.tfstate
  terraform plan
  ```

**Explanation:**
Terraform automatically keeps `.backup` files for safety.

---

### **44. You want to check which resource was last changed in the state.**

**Solution:**

```bash
terraform show -json | jq '.values.root_module.resources[] | {address, last_updated}'
```

**Explanation:**
Useful when debugging unexpected drifts or apply failures.

---

### **45. You want to deploy same infra in multiple regions automatically.**

**Solution:**
Use a for_each loop for providers:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  alias  = each.key
  region = each.value
}

variable "regions" {
  default = {
    ap_south_1 = "ap-south-1"
    us_east_1  = "us-east-1"
  }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "multi_region" {
  for_each = var.regions
  provider = aws.each.key
  bucket   = "konka-${each.key}-bucket"
}
```

**Explanation:**
Deploys infra in multiple regions in a single Terraform execution.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Terraform Real-World Scenarios (Set 4 ‚Äì Troubleshooting & Optimization)

---

### **46. You ran `terraform apply`, but it failed halfway. Some resources were created, others weren‚Äôt.**

**Problem:** Partial state recorded.

**Solution:**

1. Run again:

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

   Terraform continues from the last successful state.
2. To clean failed resources:

   * Check in console ‚Üí manually delete half-created ones if needed.
   * Re-run plan to reconcile.

**Explanation:**
Terraform is idempotent ‚Äî it will align resources with the last known good state automatically.

---

### **47. Terraform plan shows changes even though no code was modified.**

**Problem:** State drift (real infra != Terraform state).

**Solution:**

```bash
terraform refresh
terraform plan
```

If still drifted ‚Äî run `apply` to reconcile.

**Explanation:**
Cloud changes outside Terraform cause drift. Always manage infra *only* through Terraform.

---

### **48. Terraform apply taking too long.**

**Possible reasons:**

* Too many resources
* Remote backend latency
* Unnecessary dependencies (`depends_on` misused)

**Optimization Tips:**

* Use **`-parallelism`** flag:

  ```bash
  terraform apply -parallelism=20
  ```
* Split large stacks into modules (VPC, EKS, RDS separately)
* Use smaller backend states for faster plans.

---

### **49. Terraform shows ‚ÄúProvider produced inconsistent final plan‚Äù.**

**Problem:** Bug or API race between provider and Terraform.

**Fix:**

* Run again with:

  ```bash
  terraform apply -refresh-only
  ```
* If persists, upgrade provider:

  ```bash
  terraform init -upgrade
  ```

**Explanation:**
Occurs when provider APIs return unexpected or delayed values.

---

### **50. You deleted a resource manually in the console, but Terraform still thinks it exists.**

**Solution:**

1. Reconcile state:

   ```bash
   terraform refresh
   ```
2. Or remove from state:

   ```bash
   terraform state rm aws_instance.web
   terraform plan
   ```

**Explanation:**
Removes ghost entries from the state file.

---

### **51. Terraform apply fails with ‚ÄúError locking state‚Äù.**

**Cause:** Another Terraform run locked the backend (e.g., crashed).

**Solution:**

```bash
terraform force-unlock <LOCK_ID>
```

**Note:** Only do this after confirming no one else is running Terraform.

---

### **52. You get ‚ÄúState file corrupted‚Äù error after a failed run.**

**Solution:**

* If using S3 backend with versioning:

  * Restore the last good version.
* If local:

  ```bash
  cp terraform.tfstate.backup terraform.tfstate
  terraform plan
  ```

**Explanation:**
Always enable versioning for remote backends to protect against corruption.

---

### **53. You want to debug Terraform provider API calls.**

**Solution:**
Enable debug logs:

```bash
export TF_LOG=DEBUG
export TF_LOG_PATH=terraform-debug.log
terraform apply
```

**Explanation:**
Saves all logs (provider API calls, state interactions) to a file.

---

### **54. Terraform crashes unexpectedly (segmentation fault or panic).**

**Solution:**

* Run with debug mode to get trace:

  ```bash
  TF_LOG=TRACE terraform plan
  ```
* Report to HashiCorp with crash.log.
* Often caused by outdated provider or plugin mismatch.

---

### **55. You want to simulate what Terraform will destroy without actually deleting anything.**

**Solution:**

```bash
terraform plan -destroy
```

**Explanation:**
Shows a destruction plan ‚Äî helps you review what would be deleted.

---

### **56. You accidentally removed `.terraform` folder.**

**Solution:**
Reinitialize your workspace:

```bash
terraform init
```

State file (`terraform.tfstate`) remains intact, so no resources are lost.

---

### **57. You‚Äôre using Terraform Cloud but plan keeps failing with ‚ÄúPermission denied‚Äù.**

**Possible causes:**

* API token missing
* Wrong workspace variable setup

**Fix:**

* Verify environment variable:

  ```bash
  export TF_CLOUD_TOKEN=<your_token>
  ```
* Ensure VCS repo linked to workspace and has proper access.

---

### **58. You‚Äôre getting error: ‚ÄúError: Provider configuration not present‚Äù.**

**Problem:**
Provider block is missing or incorrectly scoped in modules.

**Fix:**
In root module:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = var.region
}

module "vpc" {
  source  = "../modules/vpc"
  providers = {
    aws = aws
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**
Modules need an explicit provider mapping if not inherited automatically.

---

### **59. You want to run a plan to only refresh the state without changing infrastructure.**

**Solution:**

```bash
terraform plan -refresh-only
```

**Explanation:**
Good for auditing current infra and detecting drift without modification.

---

### **60. You want to avoid storing sensitive variables (like passwords) in `.tfvars`.**

**Best Practices:**

* Use `sensitive = true` in variable definitions:

  ```hcl
  variable "db_password" {
    type      = string
    sensitive = true
  }
  ```
* Fetch from AWS Secrets Manager or SSM:

  ```hcl
  data "aws_ssm_parameter" "db_pwd" {
    name            = "/prod/db/password"
    with_decryption = true
  }
  ```
* Or use environment variable:

  ```bash
  export TF_VAR_db_password="SuperSecret123!"
  ```

**Explanation:**
Keeps secrets secure and hidden from logs, tfstate, and Git.
