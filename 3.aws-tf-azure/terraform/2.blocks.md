### **1. Provider Block**

Defines the **cloud or platform provider** Terraform will interact with (like AWS, Azure, GCP).
It tells Terraform *where to create resources*.

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "ap-south-1"
}
```

ðŸ‘‰ **Note:** Each provider uses its own API to create and manage resources.

---

### **2. Resource Block**

Used to **create or manage actual infrastructure** components (like EC2, S3, VPC, etc.).
This is the **core** of Terraform.

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "my_ec2" {
  ami           = "ami-0abcdef1234567890"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

ðŸ‘‰ **Note:**

* The first label (`aws_instance`) = resource type
* The second (`my_ec2`) = logical name
* Attributes inside define configuration.

---

### **3. Data Block**

Used to **fetch or reference existing resources** or data from providers.
Itâ€™s read-only â€” doesnâ€™t create anything.

```hcl
data "aws_ami" "ubuntu" {
  most_recent = true
  owners      = ["099720109477"]
  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server-*"]
  }
}
```

ðŸ‘‰ **Use Case:** To fetch the latest AMI ID dynamically.

---

### **4. Output Block**

Displays useful information after `terraform apply`.
Commonly used to show resource attributes like IP, ARN, etc.

```hcl
output "instance_public_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.my_ec2.public_ip
}
```

ðŸ‘‰ **Note:** Outputs can also be passed between modules.

---

### **5. Variable Block**

Defines **input variables** so you can reuse configurations.
Useful for environment differences.

```hcl
variable "instance_type" {
  type    = string
  default = "t2.micro"
}
```

ðŸ‘‰ **Note:** Values can come from `.tfvars` files, CLI, or environment variables.

---

### **6. Locals Block**

Used to define **local variables** that simplify complex expressions or reuse computed values.

```hcl
locals {
  common_tags = {
    Environment = "dev"
    Project     = "MyApp"
  }
}
```

ðŸ‘‰ **Usage:**

```hcl
tags = local.common_tags
```

---

### **7. Terraform Settings Block**

Defines **required Terraform and provider versions**, and backend configuration (for state storage).

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.5.0"

  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }

  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "terraform-state-bucket"
    key    = "dev/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "ap-south-1"
  }
}
```

ðŸ‘‰ **Note:** This block ensures version consistency and remote state setup.

---

### **8. Null Resource**

Used to **execute scripts or triggers** without managing any real infrastructure.
Helpful for running commands or orchestration logic.

```hcl
resource "null_resource" "example" {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo Deploying app..."
  }

  triggers = {
    build_number = var.build_id
  }
}
```

ðŸ‘‰ **Use Case:**

* Run scripts during CI/CD
* Trigger actions when variables change
