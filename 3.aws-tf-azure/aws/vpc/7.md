# VPC Perring

### 🌐 Benefits of Using VPC Peering
- **Private Connectivity**: Enables secure communication between VPCs using private IPs—no need for public internet.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduces data transfer costs compared to public internet routing.
- **Low Latency**: Traffic stays within the cloud provider’s backbone, improving performance.
- **Simplified Architecture**: Ideal for connecting microservices or environments across VPCs.
- **Cross-Account Access**: Allows resource sharing between VPCs in different AWS accounts or regions.

---

### 📌 When to Use VPC Peering
- You need **direct communication** between VPCs without using VPN or Transit Gateway.
- Your applications span **multiple environments** (e.g., dev, staging, prod) and need secure interconnectivity.
- You want to **share services** like databases or monitoring tools across VPCs.
- You’re working with **multi-account setups** and need seamless integration.

### ⚠️ Limitations of VPC Peering
- **No Transitive Routing**: VPC A peered with B, and B with C doesn’t mean A can talk to C.
- **Manual Configuration**: Route tables and security groups must be updated manually.
- **CIDR Overlap Restrictions**: Peering fails if VPCs have overlapping IP ranges.
- **Scaling Complexity**: Managing many peering connections can become cumbersome.
- **Limited DNS Resolution**: Requires enabling DNS hostname resolution for private IP mapping.

### 🛠️ Step-by-Step Breakdown

#### **1. Siva VPC Setup**
- **CIDR Block**: `192.168.0.0/16`
- **Subnets**:
  - Public: `192.168.1.0/24`
  - Private: `192.168.2.0/24`
- **Route Tables**:
  - Public route table with route to IGW (`0.0.0.0/0`)
  - Private route table with no internet route
- **Internet Gateway (IGW)**:
  - Create and attach to Siva VPC
  - Add route in public route table to IGW

#### **2. Ram VPC Setup**
- **CIDR Block**: `172.31.0.0/16`
- **Subnets**:
  - Public: `172.31.1.0/24`
  - Private: `172.31.2.0/24`
- **Route Tables**:
  - Public route table with route to IGW (`0.0.0.0/0`)
  - Private route table with no internet route
- **Internet Gateway (IGW)**:
  - Create and attach to Ram VPC
  - Add route in public route table to IGW

#### **3. VPC Peering Between Siva and Ram**
- **Initiate Peering**:
  - From one VPC, create a peering connection to the other
  - Accept the request in the target VPC
- **Modify Route Tables**:
  - Add routes in both VPCs to allow traffic to flow between them using private IP ranges
  - Ensure security groups allow traffic between VPCs

> ✅ This setup works across AWS accounts and regions, making it ideal for hybrid or multi-account architectures.

Here are some **tricky and scenario-based VPC peering interview questions** that test both your conceptual understanding and real-world application skills:

### 🔍 Advanced VPC Peering Interview Questions

#### 1. **Can VPC peering be transitive? Why or why not?**
> No, VPC peering does not support transitive routing. If VPC A is peered with B, and B with C, A cannot communicate with C unless a direct peering connection exists.

#### 2. **What happens if two VPCs have overlapping CIDR blocks?**
> Peering will fail. CIDR blocks must be unique and non-overlapping to avoid routing conflicts.

#### 3. **How do you enable DNS resolution across peered VPCs?**
> You must enable `DNS resolution` and `DNS hostnames` in both VPCs and modify the peering connection settings to allow DNS resolution from the remote VPC.

#### 4. **Can you peer VPCs across AWS accounts and regions?**
> Yes. VPC peering supports cross-account and inter-region peering, but you must manually update route tables and security groups in both VPCs.

#### 5. **What are the limitations of VPC peering compared to Transit Gateway?**
> VPC peering lacks transitive routing, centralized management, and scalability. Transit Gateway is better for hub-and-spoke architectures.

#### 6. **How would you troubleshoot connectivity issues between peered VPCs?**
> Check:
- Route tables for missing routes
- Security groups and NACLs
- DNS settings if using hostnames
- Peering connection status

#### 7. **Can you use VPC peering to connect VPCs in different AWS Organizations?**
> Yes, but you must ensure proper permissions via AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM) and accept the peering request manually.

#### 8. **What’s the maximum number of VPC peering connections per VPC?**
> AWS allows up to 125 peering connections per VPC (soft limit—can be increased).

#### 9. **How do you restrict access between peered VPCs to specific services or ports?**
> Use security groups and NACLs to allow only required traffic (e.g., TCP port 3306 for MySQL).

#### 10. **What happens if you delete a route in a peered VPC’s route table?**
> Communication between the VPCs will break for the affected CIDR block until the route is restored.
