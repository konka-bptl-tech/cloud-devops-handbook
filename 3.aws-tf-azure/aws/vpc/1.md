# VPC & CIDR , Secondary CIDR

An Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a logically isolated, virtual network within the AWS cloud that provides a private, secure space for launching AWS resources like EC2 instances and databases. It gives you control over a virtual data center, allowing you to define IP address ranges, create subnets (public or private), and configure routing tables to manage network traffic. VPCs enable you to define your own network topology[defining your own topology‚Äù = you design the structure and rules of your network from scratch instead of AWS deciding for you], similar to a traditional network, but with the scalability and benefits of the AWS cloud infrastructure

### Key Characteristics & Components
1. *Logical Isolation:* Your VPC is logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS cloud, ensuring a secure and private environment for your resources. 
2. *Customizable Network:* You can define your own IP address ranges (CIDR blocks), subnets, route tables, and network gateways. 
3. *Subnets:* These are subdivisions of your VPC's IP address range, used to separate resources into public (connected to the internet) and private (isolated) networks. 
4. *Route Tables:* These control the routing of traffic to and from your subnets, allowing you to direct traffic to the internet, other VPCs, or your on-premises data centers. 
5. *Internet Gateways:* Attached to a VPC to enable public subnet communication with the internet. 
6. *NAT Gateways:* Allow resources in private subnets to initiate outbound internet connections while restricting inbound traffic from the internet. 
7. *Security Groups & Access Control Lists (ACLs):* These act as firewalls to control inbound and outbound traffic at the resource and subnet level, respectively. 

In AWS, CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) is the IP address range for a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) or a subnet, with a primary CIDR being the initial IP range you define for a VPC. A secondary CIDR is an additional IP address range you can associate with an existing VPC to expand its IP address space, allowing for the creation of more subnets and resources without removing the primary CIDR block. You can add up to four secondary CIDR blocks to a VPC after its creation, but you cannot modify or remove the primary CIDR block once it's set. 


### CIDR in AWS (Virtual Private Cloud)
*Purpose:* A CIDR block defines the entire range of IP addresses for your VPC. 
*Creation:* You specify a single, primary IPv4 CIDR block when creating a VPC. 
*Subnets:* Subnets are created by taking a portion of the VPC's CIDR block and assigning it to a specific subnet. These subnet CIDRs must not overlap with each other. 
*Permanent:* The primary CIDR block remains a permanent part of the VPC configuration. 

### Secondary CIDR in AWS
*Purpose:* To expand the total IP address space of a VPC. 
*When to use:* Use secondary CIDRs to accommodate growth, allow for more subnets and resources, or for specific EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) cluster requirements. 
*Association:* You can add up to four secondary IPv4 CIDR blocks to your VPC after it's created. 
*Subnets:* You can create subnets using the IP addresses from these secondary CIDR blocks, just as you would with the primary block. 
*Route Tables:* When a secondary CIDR block is associated, a route is automatically added to the VPC's route tables for intra-VPC routing. 
*Deletion:* Secondary CIDR blocks can be removed after all associated resources and subnets are deleted.
