## **1. Security Groups (SG) – AWS**

* **What it is:** A **virtual firewall** attached to **EC2 instances** or other resources.
* **Scope:** **Instance-level**.
* **Stateful:** Yes → if you allow inbound traffic, the response is automatically allowed outbound.
* **Rules:** Only **allow rules**. No deny rules.
* **Default:** Denies all inbound traffic, allows all outbound traffic (you can modify).
* **Use case:** Control which IPs or ports can access your instance.

**Example:**

* Allow **HTTP (80)** from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)
* Allow **SSH (22)** only from your office IP

## **2. Network ACLs (NACL) – AWS**

* **What it is:** A **firewall at the subnet level**.
* **Scope:** **Subnet-level**, affects all resources in that subnet.
* **Stateless:** Yes → inbound and outbound rules are evaluated separately, response traffic **must be explicitly allowed**.
* **Rules:** Can **allow or deny** traffic.
* **Default:** Allows all inbound and outbound traffic by default.

**Example:**

* Deny **SSH (22)** from a specific IP range
* Allow **HTTP (80)** from anywhere

### **Key Differences**

| Feature    | Security Group               | Network ACL      |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Level      | Instance                     | Subnet           |
| Stateful?  | Yes                          | No               |
| Rules      | Allow only                   | Allow & Deny     |
| Default    | Deny inbound, allow outbound | Allow all        |
| Evaluation | All rules                    | First match wins |

**Simple analogy:**

* SG = **Bodyguard for each server** → checks who can enter.
* NACL = **Gate at the neighborhood** → controls all traffic coming in/out of the subnet.
