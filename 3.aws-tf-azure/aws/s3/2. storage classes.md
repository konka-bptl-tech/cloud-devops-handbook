# S3 Storage Classes

| Storage Class                                                       | What it is                                                      | Use Case / Example                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **S3 Standard**                                                     | High durability & availability, low latency. Most expensive.    | Frequently accessed data â†’ e.g., Website files, application assets.     |
| **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**                                          | Moves data automatically between frequent & infrequent tiers.   | Unknown access patterns â†’ e.g., Data lake with unpredictable usage.     |
| **S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)**                              | Lower cost than Standard, but retrieval fee.                    | Infrequent access data â†’ e.g., Backups, disaster recovery.              |
| **S3 One Zone-IA**                                                  | Same as Standard-IA but stored in **1 AZ only** (less durable). | Non-critical backups â†’ e.g., Re-creatable logs or reports.              |
| **S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval**                                    | Cheap, retrieval in **milliseconds**.                           | Archive with quick access needed â†’ e.g., Medical records, media assets. |
| **S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval** (formerly Glacier)                | Very cheap, retrieval time from **minutes to hours**.           | Archival â†’ e.g., Compliance documents, historical logs.                 |
| **S3 Glacier Deep Archive**                                         | Lowest cost, retrieval in **12â€“48 hours**.                      | Long-term archive â†’ e.g., Regulatory data, old backups.                 |
| **S3 Reduced Redundancy Storage (RRS)** *(Legacy, not recommended)* | Lower durability than Standard, cheaper.                        | Rarely used today (replaced by One Zone-IA).                            |

## Quick Examples

1. **Website hosting** â†’ S3 Standard (fast, always needed).
2. **App logs older than 30 days** â†’ Move to Standard-IA.
3. **Daily reports that can be regenerated** â†’ One Zone-IA.
4. **Financial records (7-year retention)** â†’ Glacier Deep Archive.
5. **Data science datasets with unpredictable usage** â†’ Intelligent-Tiering.

ðŸ‘‰ In short:

* **Hot data â†’ Standard**
* **Cool data â†’ Standard-IA / One Zone-IA**
* **Cold data â†’ Glacier / Deep Archive**
* **Unknown patterns â†’ Intelligent-Tiering**
