# S3 Management Features

## 1. Lifecycle Configuration (Lifecycle Rules)

* Used to **automatically manage objects** during their lifetime.
* You create **rules** to:

  * Transition objects to another **storage class** (e.g., Standard → IA → Glacier → Deep Archive).
  * Expire (delete) objects after a certain time.
  * Clean up incomplete multipart uploads.
* Example:

  * Move logs to **Standard-IA after 30 days**.
  * Move to **Glacier after 90 days**.
  * **Delete after 365 days**.

## 2. Replication Rules

* Part of **Replication Configuration**.
* Define **which objects to replicate** from source bucket to destination bucket.
* Conditions can be based on:

  * Prefix (folder-like path).
  * Tags.
* Also specify if delete markers and metadata should be replicated.
* Example:

  * Replicate all objects with prefix `prod/` to another region.
  * Don’t replicate test data.

## 3. Inventory Configurations

* Generates **periodic reports** of all objects in a bucket.
* Format: CSV, ORC, or Parquet.
* Includes metadata like:

  * Object name, size, storage class, encryption, replication status.
* Helps with:

  * **Audits** → Check if objects are encrypted.
  * **Compliance** → Verify replication.
  * **Analytics** → Run Athena/Glue queries on inventory.
* Example:

  * Daily CSV report of all objects >10 GB for cost analysis.

✅ Short One-liners for Interview:

* **Lifecycle Rules** → Automate storage transitions & object expiry.
* **Replication Rules** → Define which objects get copied between buckets.
* **Inventory Configurations** → Generate reports of objects & metadata for auditing.
