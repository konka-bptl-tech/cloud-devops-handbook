# AWS S3 Bucket Properties

## 1. Versioning

* Keeps **multiple versions** of the same object.
* Protects against accidental delete/overwrite.
* Example: `file.txt` → version 1, version 2, etc.
* Useful for backup & recovery.

---

## 2. Default Encryption

* Automatically **encrypts objects at rest** when stored in S3.
* Options:

  * **SSE-S3** (Amazon-managed keys).
  * **SSE-KMS** (AWS KMS keys).
* Ensures compliance and data security.

---

## 3. Intelligent-Tiering Archive Configurations

* Works with **S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class**.
* Automatically moves infrequently accessed data to **Archive / Deep Archive tiers**.
* Saves cost without performance impact.

---

## 4. Server Access Logging

* Stores detailed **logs of requests** made to the bucket.
* Logs are saved in another S3 bucket.
* Useful for **security audits, monitoring, troubleshooting**.

---

## 5. AWS CloudTrail Data Events

* Tracks **object-level API activity** (like `GetObject`, `PutObject`).
* Integrated with CloudTrail for logging and auditing.
* Useful for **compliance** and tracking who accessed data.

---

## 6. Event Notifications

* Triggers **notifications when events happen** in the bucket.
* Examples: Object created, deleted, restored.
* Can send events to:

  * **SNS Topic**
  * **SQS Queue**
  * **Lambda Function**

---

## 7. Amazon EventBridge

* Alternative to S3 Event Notifications (more powerful).
* Sends S3 events directly into **EventBridge bus**.
* Allows advanced event filtering & routing.
* Better for **serverless workflows**.

---

## 8. Transfer Acceleration

* Uses **CloudFront’s globally distributed edge locations**.
* Speeds up uploads/downloads to S3 across regions.
* Example: Upload from India to `us-east-1` bucket via nearest edge.

---

## 9. Object Lock

* Protects objects from being **deleted or overwritten** for a fixed time or indefinitely.
* Modes:

  * **Governance** – Admins can override if needed.
  * **Compliance** – No one can delete (even AWS).
* Useful for **legal/compliance requirements (WORM storage)**.

---

## 10. Requester Pays

* Shifts **data transfer & request costs** to the requester instead of the bucket owner.
* Good for public datasets.
* Example: If others download your big data, **they pay AWS bill**.

---

## 11. Static Website Hosting

* Enables S3 bucket to serve **static website content** (HTML, CSS, JS).
* Requires:

  * Index document (e.g., `index.html`).
  * Error document (e.g., `error.html`).
* Provides an S3 website endpoint.
