### üó£Ô∏è Conversation: Developer & DevOps Engineer on CI/CD Pipeline

**Developer:**
Hey Konka, I‚Äôve just pushed some new changes to the backend service. But I noticed the deployment didn‚Äôt trigger automatically in the staging environment. Can you check if the CI/CD pipeline is configured for this repo?

**DevOps (Konka):**
Sure. Is this for the `expense-backend` service? I remember we added the CI workflow last week in GitHub Actions. Did you push to the `develop` branch?

**Developer:**
Yeah, it was pushed to `develop`. I was expecting it to run the tests and deploy automatically.

**DevOps (Konka):**
Got it. Let me check the pipeline logs.
(After checking) ‚Äî Looks like the pipeline was skipped because the commit message didn‚Äôt match the `ci:` pattern we use for triggering builds. That‚Äôs part of our commit policy to control unnecessary builds.

**Developer:**
Ah, I see. So if I prefix my commit with `ci:` it‚Äôll trigger the pipeline?

**DevOps (Konka):**
Exactly. Once it‚Äôs triggered, it‚Äôll run unit tests, build the Docker image, push it to ECR, and ArgoCD will handle deployment automatically to the staging namespace in the cluster.

**Developer:**
Cool. And for production, is it the same flow?

**DevOps (Konka):**
Mostly, yes. But production requires a manual approval step after staging validation. The CI/CD pipeline in GitHub Actions handles testing and image building, and ArgoCD manages the deployment to the prod cluster after we approve it.

**Developer:**
That‚Äôs neat. Also, I need to add a new environment variable for an API key. Where should I keep it?

**DevOps (Konka):**
We‚Äôre using HashiCorp Vault for secrets. Add it there under your service path, and the Helm chart will inject it into the pod during deployment. Avoid hardcoding it in the manifest.

**Developer:**
Got it, thanks. This setup is saving us a lot of time compared to manual deployments.

**DevOps (Konka):**
Yeah, that‚Äôs the goal ‚Äî automate everything and reduce manual intervention. Once your PR is merged, I‚Äôll monitor the ArgoCD sync status and ensure the deployment goes smoothly.
