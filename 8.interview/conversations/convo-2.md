Perfect üëå Konka!
Here‚Äôs a **real-world-style conversation** between a **DevOps Engineer (you)** and a **Developer/Cloud Architect** about **infrastructure CI/CD** ‚Äî specifically **automating infrastructure provisioning with Terraform + ArgoCD (GitOps)**.

### üó£Ô∏è Conversation: Infrastructure CI/CD (Terraform + ArgoCD)

**Developer:**
Hey Konka, we‚Äôre planning to create a new staging environment for the expense application. Can we reuse the existing Terraform setup for that, or do we need to start from scratch?

**DevOps (Konka):**
We can definitely reuse the same Terraform modules. Our infrastructure is modular ‚Äî each environment (dev, staging, prod) has its own backend and variables. I‚Äôll just create a new `staging.tfvars` file and a corresponding S3 backend for the state file.

**Developer:**
Nice. How do you trigger the infrastructure deployment? Do you run Terraform manually?

**DevOps (Konka):**
Nope, it‚Äôs fully automated. We have a **CI/CD pipeline for infrastructure** in GitHub Actions.

* When someone raises a pull request to the `main` branch, it runs `terraform plan` automatically and posts the output in the PR.
* After approval and merge, it runs `terraform apply` to provision the resources.

**Developer:**
That‚Äôs cool. So no one touches the AWS console manually, right?

**DevOps (Konka):**
Exactly. Everything goes through code reviews and pipelines ‚Äî pure **GitOps** flow.
And once infrastructure is created, ArgoCD automatically detects the new environment and deploys the application manifests from the respective `overlays/staging` folder.

**Developer:**
Makes sense. What about secrets or credentials for Terraform?

**DevOps (Konka):**
We store those in **GitHub Secrets**, encrypted, and pass them as environment variables to the workflow ‚Äî things like AWS credentials or remote state bucket names.

**Developer:**
Got it. If something fails during apply, do you have rollback?

**DevOps (Konka):**
Yes, the state file helps with that. We can re-run the pipeline or manually roll back the commit, and Terraform will reconcile the infra automatically.
For production, we added an **approval step** before `terraform apply` to avoid accidental changes.

**Developer:**
Perfect. One last thing ‚Äî are you tagging resources for cost tracking?

**DevOps (Konka):**
Yes, every module applies a common tag set like `Environment`, `Application`, and `Owner`. It helps with cost optimization in AWS Cost Explorer later.

**Developer:**
Awesome. That‚Äôs a clean setup, Konka. Let‚Äôs go ahead with staging using your pipeline.

**DevOps (Konka):**
Sure. I‚Äôll create the new environment config and raise a PR. Once approved, the CI/CD pipeline will handle the rest ‚Äî infra setup, DNS entries, and ArgoCD sync.
