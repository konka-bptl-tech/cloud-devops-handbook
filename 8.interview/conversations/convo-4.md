Perfect, Konka 🔥 — here’s a **realistic CI pipeline debugging conversation** between a **Developer** and **you (DevOps Engineer)** using **GitHub Actions**.

### 🧩 Scenario: Application Build Failed in GitHub Actions (CI Stage)

**Developer:**
Hey Konka, my build pipeline failed on GitHub Actions. It says something about “dependency check failed” — I’m not sure what’s wrong.

**DevOps (Konka):**
Okay, let’s take a look. Which repo and workflow file?

**Developer:**
It’s in the `expense-app` repository, under `.github/workflows/build.yml`.

**DevOps (Konka):**
Cool. I see the error log — it failed at the **“Dependency Scan”** step. The `OWASP Dependency-Check` tool is reporting some vulnerable libraries in your `pom.xml`.

**Developer:**
Oh right, that’s the Maven dependency scanner, right? I didn’t realize we had that step in our build pipeline.

**DevOps (Konka):**
Yeah, we added it for security compliance. It checks your dependencies against known CVEs before allowing deployment.
You can open the detailed report in the `dependency-check-report.html` artifact.

**Developer:**
Got it. I see some medium and high severity vulnerabilities. Do I need to fix all of them before the build passes?

**DevOps (Konka):**
Not necessarily. For now, our policy blocks only **critical and high severity** CVEs.
If you can’t upgrade the dependency immediately, you can temporarily suppress it using the `suppression.xml` file — but you need approval from the security team.

**Developer:**
Understood. I’ll update the `spring-web` dependency to the latest version and push again.

**DevOps (Konka):**
Perfect. That’ll trigger the pipeline automatically.
While we’re here — I noticed the build uses a self-hosted runner. Make sure your test stage doesn’t rely on hardcoded credentials.

**Developer:**
Oh yeah, I saw some secrets in the `application.properties` — I’ll move them to GitHub Secrets.

**DevOps (Konka):**
Good catch 👏
Once you push the change, the workflow will use:

```yaml
env:
  DB_USER: ${{ secrets.DB_USER }}
  DB_PASS: ${{ secrets.DB_PASS }}
```

That keeps sensitive info out of the codebase.

**Developer:**
Nice, makes sense. Okay, I just committed and pushed. Let’s check the Actions tab.

**DevOps (Konka):**
Looks good — the dependency scan passed, tests succeeded, and the build artifact was uploaded to S3.
The pipeline is clean now ✅

**Developer:**
Awesome! Thanks, Konka.
So just to confirm — CI covers build, test, lint, and dependency scan, right?

**DevOps (Konka):**
Exactly. That’s the **CI part**.
Then ArgoCD takes over for **CD** — it syncs the latest manifests and deploys to the cluster.
This setup keeps your app secure, consistent, and fully automated.

**Developer:**
Perfect. Thanks for the quick help, man.

**DevOps (Konka):**
Anytime 😄 Next time, just glance at the dependency scan report before merging your PR — it’ll save a failed pipeline!

### ✅ Key CI/CD Takeaways

* **CI (Continuous Integration)** checks:

  * Code build
  * Unit tests
  * Linting
  * Security scans (OWASP, Trivy, etc.)
* **Secrets** → Use `GitHub Secrets` or `Vault`, not plain text.
* **Artifacts** → Store reports (like dependency scan, test coverage) for visibility.
* **Fail early** → CI stops before deployment to avoid shipping vulnerable code.
* **Automation** → Commits trigger pipelines; no manual build steps.
