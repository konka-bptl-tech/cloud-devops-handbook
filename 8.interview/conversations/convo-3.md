Perfect 🔥 Konka — here’s the **next realistic conversation** between you (DevOps Engineer) and a **Developer**, focusing on **debugging a failed ArgoCD deployment** in a Kubernetes cluster.

### 🧩 Scenario: Application Deployment Failed in ArgoCD

**Developer:**
Hey Konka, my latest deployment failed in ArgoCD. The app shows a “Sync Failed” status. Can you check what went wrong?

**DevOps (Konka):**
Sure, let me check.
(Open ArgoCD UI) — I see the error message: *“ImagePullBackOff”* for your backend pod. Did you recently update the Docker image?

**Developer:**
Yes, I pushed a new image to ECR yesterday. I changed the tag from `v1.2` to `latest`.

**DevOps (Konka):**
That might be the issue. In our ArgoCD setup, we use **immutable tags** like `v1.2`, not `latest`.
Since ArgoCD doesn’t re-pull `latest` automatically, the cluster might still be using the old image cache.

**Developer:**
Oh, I see. So I should use versioned tags instead?

**DevOps (Konka):**
Exactly. It helps with traceability and rollback.
Can you push the same image with a version tag, say `v1.3`, and update your Helm values file in GitHub?

**Developer:**
Sure, done. I committed and pushed the change.

**DevOps (Konka):**
Nice. ArgoCD should detect the change automatically within a few seconds.
(Looks at UI) Okay, it’s syncing now… pods are terminating the old version and spinning up new ones.

**Developer:**
Great! Looks like it’s healthy now. So, what exactly caused that ImagePullBackOff error?

**DevOps (Konka):**
It usually means the pod couldn’t pull the image. In this case, either the image tag didn’t exist in ECR, or Kubernetes couldn’t access it.
If it happens again, you can check it manually using:

```
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> | grep -i image
```

That shows the exact image it tried to pull.

**Developer:**
Cool tip. Thanks! How do you usually debug sync issues in ArgoCD?

**DevOps (Konka):**
Good question. I usually check three things:

1. **Application Controller logs** — for reconciliation issues.

   ```
   kubectl logs -n argocd argocd-application-controller-0
   ```
2. **Pod events** — using `kubectl describe pod`.
3. **Sync status** in ArgoCD UI — it shows if manifests are out of sync or missing dependencies.

**Developer:**
That’s super helpful. I’ll remember to version my images from now on.

**DevOps (Konka):**
Perfect 👍 That keeps the deployment stable and predictable.
Also, next time you push new manifests, just ensure the image tag is updated — ArgoCD will take care of the rollout automatically.

### ✅ Key CI/CD & Debugging Takeaways

* **ImagePullBackOff** → issue with image tag or access.
* **Immutable tags** (v1.1, v1.2, etc.) are better than `latest`.
* **ArgoCD auto-sync** picks up changes from Git automatically.
* **Debugging Tools:**

  * ArgoCD controller logs.
  * `kubectl describe pod` for event-level errors.
  * ArgoCD UI sync diff to check drift.
* **GitOps Discipline:** Update image tags in Git, not manually in cluster.
