Perfect üòé Konka ‚Äî here‚Äôs the **next realistic workplace conversation** between you (**DevOps Engineer**) and a **Cloud Architect** about **cost optimization and collaboration** in a real-time production environment.

This covers your **‚ÄúCollaboration with other teams‚Äù** and **‚ÄúCost Optimization‚Äù** points from your list.

### üß© Scenario: Monthly AWS Cost Review & Optimization Discussion

**Cloud Architect:**
Hey Konka, I went through our monthly AWS bill ‚Äî it‚Äôs a bit higher than expected, especially in the ECS and EKS workloads. Have you noticed anything unusual?

**DevOps (Konka):**
Yeah, I noticed that too. I ran a quick cost breakdown using **AWS Cost Explorer** and **CloudWatch metrics** last week.
The main cost spikes are coming from:

1. Over-provisioned EKS nodes.
2. Unused EBS volumes from old deployments.
3. A few S3 buckets storing uncompressed logs.

**Cloud Architect:**
Good catch. Can you explain more about the EKS part?

**DevOps (Konka):**
Sure. Some microservices in the staging cluster were requesting high CPU/memory limits even though their average utilization was under 30%.
I‚Äôve already created a **Grafana dashboard** using **Prometheus metrics** to monitor real usage.
We can tune their resource requests using the **Vertical Pod Autoscaler** and set **Cluster Autoscaler** to scale nodes dynamically.

**Cloud Architect:**
That‚Äôs great. We can save a lot by adjusting instance sizes. What about the storage costs?

**DevOps (Konka):**
Right now, all our EBS volumes are gp3 type, but some workloads like Jenkins agents and Prometheus storage don‚Äôt need high IOPS.
We can downgrade some of them to **st1** (throughput optimized) volumes.
Also, I found a few old EBS snapshots ‚Äî I‚Äôm planning to use **AWS Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM)** to automatically clean up snapshots older than 15 days.

**Cloud Architect:**
Nice automation. What about S3?

**DevOps (Konka):**
We‚Äôre storing raw logs in S3 Standard.
I‚Äôll move them to **S3 Intelligent-Tiering** and enable **object compression** before upload.
Also, I‚Äôve proposed a **lifecycle policy** ‚Äî after 30 days ‚Üí move to **Glacier**, after 90 days ‚Üí delete.
That should bring down costs by around 20‚Äì25%.

**Cloud Architect:**
Excellent. Are we tracking these optimizations somewhere?

**DevOps (Konka):**
Yes, I maintain a **Cost Optimization dashboard** in Grafana.
It pulls metrics from **AWS CUR (Cost and Usage Report)** and shows daily spend per service.
Plus, we have a Slack alert integrated via **EventBridge** ‚Äî if the daily spend crosses a threshold, it notifies both of us.

**Cloud Architect:**
Perfect. I like how proactive you are.
Let‚Äôs document this and share it with the **Finance** and **Application** teams ‚Äî they can also help by reviewing underutilized services.

**DevOps (Konka):**
Absolutely. I‚Äôll schedule a quick sync with the Application team to right-size their containers and align with our new resource limits.

Also, for long-term optimization, I‚Äôm planning to test **Karpenter** in our EKS cluster. It dynamically provisions the right-sized EC2 instances, better than Cluster Autoscaler.

**Cloud Architect:**
That‚Äôs a solid plan, Konka. Go ahead ‚Äî test it in the dev cluster first.
Let‚Äôs review the savings in next month‚Äôs report.

**DevOps (Konka):**
Sure thing! I‚Äôll keep tracking metrics and update you weekly.
