Awesome 😎 — here’s the **next realistic conversation** between you (*Konka, DevOps Engineer*) and a **Developer/Infra Engineer**, focusing on **infrastructure CI/CD using Terraform + GitHub Actions + ArgoCD**.

This covers your **“CI/CD for Infrastructure”** point from your “Tell me about yourself” list.

### 🧩 Scenario: Infrastructure Pipeline for Multi-Environment Deployment

**Developer (Infra Team):**
Hey Konka, our Terraform pipeline failed while deploying the new VPC for the staging environment. Can you take a look?

**DevOps (Konka):**
Sure, which workflow run? The `infra-terraform.yml` one?

**Developer:**
Yeah, the same one. It failed during the `terraform apply` step with an S3 backend error.

**DevOps (Konka):**
(Checks GitHub Actions logs)
Right, it says:

```
Error acquiring state lock: resource temporarily unavailable
```

Looks like someone else’s job was running simultaneously and locked the state file in the S3 backend.

**Developer:**
Oh, that’s why. We had another PR deploying the dev environment at the same time.

**DevOps (Konka):**
Exactly. Since both environments share the same backend bucket, the lock got conflicted.
We can fix this by **separating backend files per environment** — one for dev, one for stage, one for prod.

**Developer:**
Makes sense. Should we use separate `backend.tf` files?

**DevOps (Konka):**
Yes, I already have that in our folder structure.
Here’s how it looks:

```
infra/
├── modules/
│   ├── vpc/
│   ├── eks/
│   ├── rds/
│   └── sg/
├── environments/
│   ├── dev/
│   │   ├── main.tf
│   │   ├── backend.tf
│   │   └── dev.tfvars
│   ├── stage/
│   │   ├── main.tf
│   │   ├── backend.tf
│   │   └── stage.tfvars
│   └── prod/
│       ├── main.tf
│       ├── backend.tf
│       └── prod.tfvars
```

Each `backend.tf` points to a unique S3 path to avoid locking issues.

**Developer:**
Got it. So how does GitHub Actions handle deployments per environment?

**DevOps (Konka):**
Each environment has its own workflow trigger.
For example:

* When you push to the `develop` branch → runs Terraform for **dev**.
* When you push to the `staging` branch → runs for **stage**.
* When you merge to `main` → runs for **prod** (requires manual approval).

**Developer:**
Nice! And where does ArgoCD come in?

**DevOps (Konka):**
After Terraform finishes provisioning — like VPC, EKS, RDS — the ArgoCD app watches our **GitOps repo** that stores Kubernetes manifests.
ArgoCD automatically detects infra changes (like new cluster or namespaces) and deploys workloads accordingly.

**Developer:**
So Terraform manages cloud infra, and ArgoCD handles app-level deployment. That’s clean.

**DevOps (Konka):**
Exactly — that’s our layered CI/CD approach:

1. **Terraform + GitHub Actions** → Infrastructure provisioning.
2. **ArgoCD (GitOps)** → Application deployment.
3. **Policy checks** → Using `terraform validate`, `tflint`, and `checkov` in CI to ensure compliance before apply.

**Developer:**
Makes sense. The pipeline looks much clearer now. Can we add auto-plan comments on PRs?

**DevOps (Konka):**
Already done 😎 — the pipeline runs `terraform plan` on every PR and comments the output in GitHub before merging.
That way reviewers can see the infra changes before approving.

**Developer:**
Perfect! Thanks, Konka. You’ve automated the whole thing — feels like a mini AWS Control Tower!

**DevOps (Konka):**
Haha exactly 😄 — the idea is full automation, zero manual CLI commands.
You just push code → CI runs checks → CD applies changes safely.
