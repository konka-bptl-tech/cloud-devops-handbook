### **1. Tell me about yourself**

👉 Structure it in 4 parts:

* **Intro**: Name + role + years of experience.
* **Core Skills**: Highlight DevOps, AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD, Monitoring.
* **Projects**: Mention domains (e-commerce, migration, 3-tier infra).
* **Closing**: Future goal (AWS Solutions Architect / DevOps Engineer).

**Example draft:**
“My name is Konka, I have 4.5 years of experience as a DevOps Engineer. I’ve worked mainly on Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS services, and CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions and Jenkins. Most of my projects were microservices-based, including an e-commerce platform with 70+ services and a 3-tier application migration to AWS. My strength is in infrastructure automation, security, and observability. Currently, I’m preparing for a role where I can contribute my skills in AWS cloud engineering and modern DevOps practices.”

### **2. Explain your projects**

👉 Use **STAR (Situation → Task → Action → Result)** method.

**Example draft (E-commerce Microservices Project):**

* **Situation**: “I worked on an e-commerce application with 70+ microservices running on Kubernetes.”
* **Task**: “My responsibility was to manage deployments, Helm charts, and enforce security policies.”
* **Action**: “I created and maintained Helm charts, applied network policies for pod-to-pod security, and implemented Istio for service-to-service communication. Also automated CI/CD using GitHub Actions.”
* **Result**: “This improved deployment speed and reduced misconfigurations, ensuring secure and smooth releases.”

---

### **3. Day-to-Day Activities**

👉 Keep it **practical and real**.

* Working in Agile (daily standups, sprint planning).
* Managing Kubernetes workloads (deployments, scaling, monitoring pods).
* Writing Terraform code for infra provisioning.
* Maintaining CI/CD pipelines.
* Monitoring applications using Prometheus/Grafana and CloudWatch.
* Supporting teams with infra/security issues.

### **4. Career Gap**

👉 Keep it short and positive.
“I had a career gap for personal reasons (or upskilling). During this time, I focused on improving my DevOps skills, worked on personal projects, and learned AWS/Terraform/Kubernetes deeply. Now I am ready to apply that knowledge in my next role.”

---

### **5. Where do you see yourself in 5 years?**

👉 Show stability + growth mindset.
“In 5 years, I see myself as a senior DevOps engineer or AWS solutions architect, leading cloud migration and automation initiatives, and mentoring teams.”

---

### **6. Why don’t you have certifications?**

👉 Be confident but not defensive.
“I believe practical knowledge and hands-on experience are more important. I focused on real project work, but I do plan to pursue AWS and Kubernetes certifications to strengthen my profile in the future.”

---

### **7. Strengths & Weakness**

👉 Keep balance (don’t say cliché answers).

* **Strengths**: Quick learner, good at troubleshooting, strong in infra automation, adaptable to new tools.
* **Weakness**: Sometimes I focus too much on perfection, which can slow me down, but I’m improving by balancing speed with accuracy.
