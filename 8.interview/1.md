Here’s a strong **“Tell me about yourself”** you can use in interviews that covers all your points. I’ll keep it natural, structured, and conversational:

---

I have 4.5 years of experience as a DevOps Engineer, focusing on building and managing infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines. In my current role at \[Your Company Name], I’m responsible for setting up and maintaining cloud infrastructure, primarily on AWS, and implementing automation solutions to improve deployment efficiency and reliability.

I have hands-on experience with a wide range of tools and technologies, including Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, AWS services (like EC2, ECS, RDS, S3, CloudWatch), GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Ansible, Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack for monitoring and logging.

In terms of projects, I’ve worked on migrating monolithic applications to microservices hosted on ECS and Kubernetes, setting up CI/CD pipelines from scratch, implementing Infrastructure as Code using Terraform, and creating secure and scalable AWS architectures. One of my key projects involved a three-tier application where the frontend was in S3, the backend in ECS, and the database in RDS — I designed and deployed the entire infrastructure and automated deployments.

I collaborate closely with development, QA, and security teams to streamline releases, ensure compliance, and improve performance. I’m also part of the on-call support rotation, where I handle incidents, troubleshoot issues related to deployments, infrastructure, and performance, and ensure high availability.

My troubleshooting skills involve identifying bottlenecks in CI/CD pipelines, debugging Kubernetes pod and container issues, resolving networking or scaling challenges on AWS, and analyzing logs to quickly resolve production incidents.

I regularly attend and contribute to stand-up meetings, sprint planning sessions, release planning, and incident review meetings. This helps ensure alignment between teams and continuous improvement of processes.

Overall, I’m passionate about automation, reliability, and building scalable infrastructure, and I enjoy mentoring and knowledge sharing within my team.
