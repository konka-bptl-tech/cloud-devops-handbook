I have 4.5 years of experience as a DevOps Engineer, focusing on building and managing infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines. In my current role at \[Your Company Name], I’m responsible for setting up and maintaining cloud infrastructure, primarily on AWS, and implementing automation solutions to improve deployment efficiency and reliability.

I have hands-on experience with a wide range of tools and technologies, including Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, AWS services (like EC2, ECS, RDS, S3, CloudWatch), GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Ansible, Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack for monitoring and logging.

In terms of projects, I’ve worked on migrating monolithic applications to microservices hosted on ECS and Kubernetes, setting up CI/CD pipelines from scratch, implementing Infrastructure as Code using Terraform, and creating secure and scalable AWS architectures. One of my key projects involved a three-tier application where the frontend was in S3, the backend in ECS, and the database in RDS — I designed and deployed the entire infrastructure and automated deployments.

I collaborate closely with development, QA, and security teams to streamline releases, ensure compliance, and improve performance. I’m also part of the on-call support rotation, where I handle incidents, troubleshoot issues related to deployments, infrastructure, and performance, and ensure high availability.

My troubleshooting skills involve identifying bottlenecks in CI/CD pipelines, debugging Kubernetes pod and container issues, resolving networking or scaling challenges on AWS, and analyzing logs to quickly resolve production incidents.

I regularly attend and contribute to stand-up meetings, sprint planning sessions, release planning, and incident review meetings. This helps ensure alignment between teams and continuous improvement of processes.

Overall, I’m passionate about automation, reliability, and building scalable infrastructure, and I enjoy mentoring and knowledge sharing within my team.

In my day-to-day activities, I work in an **Agile environment** with 2-week sprints where I participate in sprint planning, backlog refinement, and retrospectives. I collaborate closely with developers, QA, product owners, and other stakeholders to ensure features are delivered on time. As part of Agile practices, I also attend **daily standup calls** where I share what I worked on yesterday, what I plan to do today, and any blockers I am facing. This helps me coordinate with cross-functional teams and resolve dependencies quickly.

Monitoring is another key part of my role. I keep track of **CI/CD pipelines** to ensure builds, tests, and deployments are running smoothly using tools like **GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and Argo CD**. I also monitor **infrastructure health, resource utilization, and failures** with tools such as **Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch, and the ELK stack**, taking proactive actions whenever alerts or incidents arise.

On the **Cloud and DevOps side**, I manage infrastructure by creating and maintaining cloud resources like VPCs, EC2, ECS, RDS, S3, EKS, and IAM, while following Infrastructure as Code practices. I also onboard new pipelines for applications, troubleshoot broken pipelines, and fix issues in build or deploy stages. In terms of **cluster management**, I handle Kubernetes and ECS clusters, scale workloads, manage upgrades, and ensure high availability. Additionally, I make sure that all processes are supported by proper **documentation** for deployments, infrastructure setup, and troubleshooting.

Finally, I am also involved in **migration activities**, such as moving infrastructure from CloudFormation templates to Terraform to achieve better reusability, modularity, and environment management. Alongside this, I help migrate applications from legacy setups to modern CI/CD pipelines, ensuring zero downtime and smooth cutovers during the migration process.
